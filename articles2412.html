		SECURITY AND PARK RULES:</p>
	<p>
		Please remember at all times that we are being hosted by the NYC Park Department to whom we are very grateful. Their rules must be enforced.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			There is absolutely no alcohol allowed in the park.</li>
		<li>
			No parking or driving in restricted areas. Where driving is allowed, do not exceed 5 mph. Cars should be parked in designated lots. That being said, the Park Department kindly allows us to bring in race support vehicles to park near the race. This is an unofficial courtesy that the Park offers us. However, should an official direct you that you are not allowed to park or drive in a particular area, by all means, that instruction must be strictly honored.</li>
		<li>
			No hanging of laundry in public to dry. During darkness, the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team will provide as many guards as possible to watch the course. However, all runners should be vigilant and anything suspicious should be immediately reported to the on-duty Race Director.</li>
	</ul>

<p class="documentDescription">July 29, 2007 [Shirley, NY] – Amidst roaring aircraft engines, rumbling thunder and astonished ground crew, 76 year-old fitness champion Sri Chinmoy power-lifted 7 light aircraft this afternoon in a massive demonstration of strength and inner will. Sri Chinmoy lifted a total of 16,189 pounds in just a couple of hours—including a Schweitzer glider aircraft with just his right arm at 545 pounds while seated!</p>
<div class="newsImageContainer"><a href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/news/aircraft_lifts/image/image_view_fullscreen"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/files/sri_chinmoy/news/aircraft_lifts" width="100" alt="76 Year-Old Sri Chinmoy Lifts 7 Aircraft" title="Sri Chinmoy's seated one arm lift of the Schweitzer glider." height="133" width="200" class="newsImage"/></a>
<p class="discreet">Sri Chinmoy's seated one arm lift of the Schweitzer glider.</p>
</div>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>Dozens of enthusiasts and fitness advocates joined the strongman at Brookhaven Calabro Airport in Shirley, New York to witness this feat of sheer determination and concentration.</p>
<p>Age-defying athlete Sri Chinmoy said, “I am 76 years old. I live in the heart. When we live in the heart, we have no obstructions, no barriers. If we live in the heart, where there is oneness, nothing is impossible. Everything is possible."</p>
<p>Using custom-made apparatuses, Sri Chinmoy lifted a Schweitzer I-26E glider at 545 lbs. with his right arm from a seated overhead position; then 4 light aircrafts [CT Light Sport at 1014lbs, Evektor Sportsar 750 at 980lbs, 1942 Culver Cadet at 1149lbs, RV4 at 1214lbs] overhead on a modified standing calf-raise machine, and two air show planes—a Globe Swift at 2252lbs and Xtra 300 at 2455lbs--on a standing calf-raise platform.</p>
<p>Today’s lifts have capped an extraordinary journey for Sri Chinmoy. Now having lifted a total of 33 airplanes, he has paid tribute to the role of this class of airplanes in aviation history. Not only the pioneers to modern jet aviation, light aircraft continue to play a vital role in search and rescue missions.</p>
<p>Jim Smith, registrar of the British Amateur Weightlifters Association and noted strength expert, said “Sri Chinmoy is a marvellous example of what human beings have the potential to do.”</p>
<p>Five-time Mr. Universe and renowned fitness expert Bill Pearl said, “Sri Chinmoy is still achieving at age 76 what the greatest strength athletes could never do in their prime!”</p>
<p>In July 2003, Sri Chinmoy celebrated the “Century of Flight” at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington by lifting overhead 100 pilots and presenting each of them a special award – the Lifting Up the World with a Oneness-Heart medallion. He, too, was honored on that day as an Honorary Member of the Civil Air Patrol of the United States Air Force.</p>

                <div class="page-body">
            <p class="documentDescription">Appropriately dubbed ‘the First Lady of the marathon’ Norweigan Grete Waitz became a role model for millions of women by putting women’s running into the limelight in the seventies and eighties and by giving it the worldwide attention and prestige it deserved.</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>Waitz started out on the track, being an Olympian 1500 metre runner in 1976, when she reached the semi-finals. She ran a world record in the 3000 metres on the track in 1975 and 1976 and in the 10K on the road in 1980 and became world cross-country champion a grand total of five times. But her greatest successes and glories would be found in the marathon, for which she became at once the first female champion and its foremost ambassador.</p>
<p>Waitz’ marathon journey commenced in 1978 when she ran her first New York City marathon. Despite of training reasonably little she set a world record time of 2:32:30 and finished with a nine minute lead over the next woman. Her award at the time was a twenty dollar bill which paid for her cab-fare to the airport. Yet the world had discovered a real champion and she became the cynosure of media-attention. The next year she sharpened the world record to 2:27 and a year later she brought it down to 2:25, both times in the New York marathon, which she won a total of nine times during her career. Her first three marathon attempts were all good for a world record. Her title of world’s best therefore came as no surprise when she won the first World Championships marathon in Helsinki in 1983.</p>
<p>Everybody expected Waitz to win gold at the first ever woman’s marathon at the Olympic Games of 1984 in L.A. But it was not to be. A nagging back injury kept Waitz out of her concentration for the first part of the race and when America’s Joan Benoit made her historic move after only three miles she did not have the strength to respond. Benoit kept her lead throughout the entire race and wrote history, whereas Waitz grabbed silver. However, her cheerful spirit brooked no disappointment or frustration. And although the Norwegian press considered her silver medal a failure, Waitz could not help but laugh at their short-sightedness. Her response is flooded with her natural wisdom: “Why are you disappointed? You haven’t run. I’m the one who has run and I’m satisfied, so why can’t you be satisfied as well?”</p>
<p>Apart from her grandiose achievements and victories the most significant thing Grete Waitz accomplished in her running career is that she gave women’s running the importance and value it needed to be ranked equally alongside the men. Although she certainly wasn’t the only one, she most certainly was the most influential. Owing to Waitz’ great performances in the marathon, her unassuming, kind and self-giving nature and her encouragement to women all over the world to start exercising and become fit, Grete Waitz became the inspiration behind the growing respect and enthusiasm people developed for women’s running. When Waitz first started running in 1966 there was hardly any room for women in the sport. There was no woman’s Olympic marathon – in fact women were not allowed to participate in the marathon at all – nor a woman’s 3,000 or 10,000 metres Olympic race, nor was there any prize money involved for female runners. In 1990, when Waitz ended her competitive career, all these things had changed and women’s running had earned a status equal to that of the men.</p>
<p>And aside from being a great runner Grete Waitz is also a great human being: kind, humble, down-to-earth and always quite averse to all the attention and fame her running brought her.</p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Emil Zatopek is one of those very rare athletes likely to stand the test of time and live on in people’s hearts and minds throughout the centuries. Not merely for his glorious achievements in the running world will he be remembered – of which there are many – but also and especially for his kind, generous and self-giving nature. Zatopek not only won gold medals on the track and on the road, he also won over the hearts of millions of sports fans all over the world.</p>

<p class="caption">Emil Zatopek</p>
</div>
<p>In his athletic career, which lasted fom 1946 until 1956, Zatopek set eighteen world records and won five Olympic medals. He became the only man in history to hold eight world records at the same time. He held the world record for every distance between 5,000 metres and 30,000 metres. He was the first to break 29 minutes for the 10,000 metres and the first to run 20 kilometres under the hour. Between the years of 1948 and 1954 he won every single 10,000 metres race he entered – an incredible victory streak of 38 wins. But Zatopek is remembered most for his unprecedented sweep at the Helsinki Olympics of 1952, where he became the first and, we may safely assume, the only athlete ever to win a gold medal in all three long distance running races: the 5,000 metres, 10,000 metres and the marathon. Because of these supreme achievements Zatopek is considered by many to be the greatest runner of all times.</p>
<p>Yet Zatopek was not only a great runner, he also was a great innovator. He became one of the first and most certainly the most succesful runner who started using the now widely accepted idea of interval training. When asked for the reason why he would run between 20 and 40 laps around the track on a daily basis, his simple comment was “You must be fast enough – you must have endurance. So you run fast for speed and repeat it many times for endurance.” His profound insight has today become the foundation for any serious athlete’s training program.</p>
<p>Yet above his athletic achievements and greatness as a runner shines his unique, amiable and inimitable personality. Emil Zatopek was indeed loved by all who knew him. He summed up his own life-philosophy in a single, lofty utterance: <em>“Great is the victory, but the friendship of all is greater.”</em> Two anecdotes from his life reveal what a magnanimous and gentle person he was at heart.</p>
<p>In 1966 multi-world-record holder and Australian distance runner Ron Clarke visited Zatopek in Prague, at the height of Clarke’s career. Although Clarke held world records at various distances he had never won a gold medal at the Olympics, the dream of any great runner. When Zatopek dropped him off at the airport at the end of their stay he handed him a small package and said, “Look after this; you deserve it.” When he was alone in the airplane Clarke opened the package and received the surprise of his life! For in front of his eyes was Zatopek’s own gold medal from the Helsinki Olympics 10,000 metre race with an inscription to Clarke.</p>
<p>Zatopek’s main rival in the running world was the Frenchman Alain Mimoun. Although Mimoun was a superb runner he was fated to be an eternal second, always finishing behind Zatopek in almost every race they entered together. Yet in the marathon of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics for the first time of his life Mimoun beat Zatopek in an Olympic race and won the gold medal. Mimoun waited for Zatopek at the finish line, who came in a tired sixth and then asked him, “Emil, why don’t you congratulate me? I have won! I am the Olympic champion!” Mimoun recalls Zatopek’s reaction from memory: “Emil turned and looked at me as if he were waking from a dream. Then he snapped to attention. Emil took off his cap — that white painting cap he wore so much — and he saluted me. Then he embraced me.” When telling the story Mimoun is still overhelmed with emotion. “Oh, for me,” he said, “that was better than the medal.”</p>
<p>Spiritual teacher and running enthousiast <a class="reference" href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has had the good fortune to meet with the immortal Czech runner. He even wrote a book about Zatopek, entitled <em>Emil Zatopek: Earth's Tearing Cry And Heaven's Beaming Smile</em>. Sri Chinmoy concludes his book by a deep and spiritual comment on this champion of champions:</p>
<blockquote>“Zatopek's greatness has surprised mankind. His goodness has illumined mankind. His fullness has elevated mankind.”</blockquote>

            <p class="documentDescription">An inspirational read: 26.2 Marathon Stories, by Kathrine Switzer and Roger Robinson</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>Anything you ever wanted to know about the mighty marathon race is in this book. If you have ever taken part in a marathon, running or supporting, you will find yourself compelled to keep reading chapter after chapter, as the topics roll from the history and first beginnings of the race, (which turns out to be somewhat fictional), to the ecstasy of the completion, with many stages in between; a total of 26.2, or 27, topics.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the health benefits of running are widely accepted and documented, but this knowledge is actually quite recent. A New York Times issue from 1909 declared,</p>
<blockquote>"Every man who undertakes the running of 26 miles weakens his heart and shortens his life. For the great majority of adults particularly in an urban population, to take part in a Marathon race is to risk serious and permanent injury to health, with immediate death a danger not very remote."</blockquote>
<p>The popularity and acceptance of marathon running actually only began in the 1960's. One of the instigators was the great New Zealand running coach, Arthur Lydiard, who wrote a landmark book called 'Run for Your Life'. He maintained that running was good for everybody, and his philosophy produced astounding results, particularly with post-cardiac patients.</p>
<p>Some of the scientifically proven side effects of running quoted from 26.2 Marathon Stories are;</p>
<blockquote>"By strengthening the heart, running reduces the rate of heart disease. By pumping oxygen and antioxidants, it combats carcinogenic free radicals, and so reduces the incidence of many forms of cancer...it diminishes lingering toxins. By raising body temperature to fever level on a daily basis, it burns out infection. By stimulating sweating and increasing breath exchange, it eliminates toxins via the skin and expelled air. By releasing adrenaline, it flushes the system with disease-fighting white blood cells and immune substances. By reducing body weight, it counters the effects of obesity- stress on the heart, joints, lungs and muscles, and non-insulin dependant diabetes. By stimulating endorphins, it alleviates stress, counters depression, and enhances creativity and problem solving. By strengthening bones, it radically reduces the incidence of osteoporosis...finally, by leaving the body fulfilled and tired, running helps maintain healthy sleep patterns."</blockquote>
<p>One chapter entitled 'motivations' quotes many well-known, and some unknown, runners;</p>
<blockquote>"If you want to run, run a mile. If you want to experience another life, run a marathon'</blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Emil Zatopek.</p>
<blockquote>"There are only three winners: the one who competes with himself, the one who crosses the finish line first, and the one who finishes the race'</blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> <a class="reference" href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>, The Outer Running and Inner Running.</p>
<blockquote>"We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves. It also does us good because it helps us to do other things better. It gives a man the chance to bring out power that might otherwise remain locked away inside himself. The urge to struggle lies latent in everyone"</blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Roger Bannister, FIRST FOUR MINUTES.</p>
<blockquote>"I started running at age 72 because I was tired of all the boring talk about funerals"</blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Ruth Rothfarb (who ran her first marathon at age 81)</p>
<p>26.2 Marathon Stories tells of the fight for women to race, which Kathrine Switzer brought to world attention in 1967 when she broke the rules by running the then 'males only' Boston Marathon. Today nearly half of the marathon runners are, in fact, women.</p>
<p>Many great running heroes are documented, giving great inspiration to the reader, however the focus is well balanced between the elite athletes and the millions of people around the world who bravely take up the challenge, experience the struggles, and are left with that unmatchable feeling of the completion of the race. A highly recommendable read for all aspiring marathon runners and non runners alike.</p>

            <p class="documentDescription">A beginner's guide to Fell Racing By Roger Chamberlain, Sri Chinmoy Athletic Club, Cardiff. This article is a short introduction to fell racing in the UK for the total beginner. It covers the essential topics of kitting yourself out for the event, training, choosing your race and race day itself.</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br/></div>
</div>
<p>I have been running in the mountains of England and Wales for about seven years now and have represented my club, the <a class="reference" href="http://uk.srichinmoyraces.org/">Sri Chinmoy AC</a> , in numerous races from 'S' class events under two miles to 'L' class runs taking several hours. I've made plenty of mistakes, gradually discovered how to get the best out of myself in a fell race and learnt a great deal on the way. I'm not the most experienced of fell runners, but you are a complete beginner wanting to try fell racing I hope this article will answer most of your questions.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br/></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choosing-your-target-race">
<h3>Choosing your target race.</h3>
<p>My first fell race was an 'AL' of 17 miles with several thousand feet of ascent. Having run several marathons and even an ultra (the Sri Chinmoy 47 Mile Race), I thought I should be fit to race over that distance. I has also seen fellow <a class="reference" href="http://uk.srichinmoyraces.org/">Sri Chinmoy AC</a> members complete the 90+ mile West Highland Way and other endurance events, and I seriously underestimated what I was taking on. I "blew up" part way through the second climb, light headed and totally spent. The strain had an effect on my digestion and I experienced painful stomach cramps on the downhill sections which could otherwise have offered some respite. I staggered over the line quite near the back of the field - not quite last - resolving to build myself up with some shorter events before tackling another epic.</p>
<p>Even if you are very fit, the best approach to fell racing is to enter some short class B or C races (the class indicates how many feet of climbing there are per mile) before tackling a longer or tougher event. Races listed as BS or CS in the FRA calendar (or the equivalent publication in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland) would be ideal.</p>
<p>Another factor in choosing your race, apart from the distance and climb involved, is the need for navigation. Races listed as NS and ER in the calendar require navigational skills and fell racing experience. A listing of LK indicates that local knowledge would be an advantage. If in doubt, call or email the race organiser and ask how suitable the race is for a beginner.</p>

<div class="section" id="equipment-for-fell-running">
<h3>Equipment for Fell Running</h3>
<p>By the time you've run on the fells enough to want to race on them, you should know pretty well which fell shoes are right for you. Don't be tempted to try anything new on the day - tried and trusted is best.</p>
<p>As far as clothing is concerned, take what you need for the worst-case-scenario conditions. In a short race you can probably run in minimal kit (vest &amp; shorts) unless the weather conditions are bad. Remember this means the conditions up top as well as those at the start - things could be somewhat different up at 2000' compared to what's going on down in the valley. A short race may not have mandatory kit requirements, but you may want to carry an extra layer (e.g. jacket) in your bum bag even if it's not required by the rules. The race organiser may insist that you carry full body cover (windproof or waterproof depending on how bad the weather is) as well as emergency food, a suitable map, a compass and a whistle. Maps and compasses are mandatory in many races, as is the whistle for attracting attention if you get lost or injured. Learning how to navigate is outside the scope of this article (see bibliography - the mountain-craft book has a good chapter on compass work). If you aren't confident to navigate, select a race where navigational skills are not essential - there are some that use paths that can be easily followed and others that utilise course markers (usually hazard tape pegged at regular intervals). Again, the race organiser will advise you about the requirements for their own event.</p>
<p>Kit needs to be carried in a bum bag (waist pack) that fits well enough for you to run at race pace while wearing it. Pete Bland, Lowe Alpine and OMM all produce suitable bags which you can find at running shops and some hiking/camping stores.</p>
<p>Runners vary wildly in their clothing requirements during races - some are prone to overheating and need to race in vest &amp; shorts even when it's cold. Others experience a dip in performance unless they wear layers to keep them warm. Learn in advance what your requirements are and stick to them on race day even if more experienced runners are all in very different kit to you.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="training-for-a-fell-race">
<h3>Training for a Fell Race.</h3>
<p>It's not rocket science - to race on hills you need to train on hills. The simplest way to train for a short fell race is to do some runs on hills of similar toughness - if the race is three miles of running with eight hundred feet of climbing, then work up to that in your training. Start with shorter climbs, or start by walking up and jogging down. Walking is a part of fell running - in most races the competitors are walking at least part of the climb, as it's more efficient to do that than to run it all as fast as you can then collapse at the top with no energy left to run down (while those who took it easy on the climb come sailing past). So the easiest way to train for your race is to get out on the mountains and walk-run your way up and down, getting used to the challenges of both climbing and descending and generally getting to know the fells and your own capabilities. Gradually, your ankles will get stronger and better able to cope with the uneven ground, your leg muscles will develop (especially the quads) and your balance and ability to pick the best line through fell country will improve.</p>
<p>Extra sessions you can work into your program could include "reps" (repetitions) of short climbs and/or descents which might be something you can do every day even of the mountains are not nearby. I practise repetitions on a short slope (1-2 minutes of steep climbing) behind my local supermarket, whereas a "proper" fell run involves a drive of at least half an hour to my nearest thousand foot mountain. If you can't get out to proper hill country regularly, at least try to train off-road so you get used to the uneven terrain. Obviously you need to include hilly, or at least undulating, courses in your weekly routine as much as possible.</p>
<p>I could get much more precise and technical about the requirements, as some coaches doubtlessly would if you asked them about fell-race training, but I think as simple approach that gets you out there having fun and gradually brings you to the right level of preparedness for a fell race is the most sensible approach. Once you have a few fell races under your belt, you can think about honing your performance with more elaborate or challenging training.</p>

<div class="section" id="race-day">
<h3>Race Day</h3>
<p>This is the exciting bit. Racing in the fells. Of course, as in road racing, excitement can lead to a runner going off way too fast and "blowing up" or "hitting the wall" (running out of energy and feeling totally spent). Take it easy at the start and don't expect to be keeping up with vastly more experienced fell runners - if you are, it will probably spell trouble later on. Remember that downhill running is also very taxing, so even if the race only involves a single ascent and descent, you can't use up all your fuel on the climb.</p>
<p>Before the race begins, you need to warm up well to get your body ready for the tough task ahead - this is more important in fell racing than in some other events because shorter races are likely to begin with a challenging climb, which your body won't find easy if you go for it "cold", straight from the car. Everyone is different, but I find fifteen to twenty minutes of slow jogging enough to get my body warmed up ready to race. I usually add in a few short dashes up and down slopes to get my leg muscles used to the ascending/descending. During this warm-up you'll find out if you are over- or underdressed for the conditions and you might want to adjust your kit accordingly. Mentally, my preparation consists of a few moments of silence after warm-up and before the start. This helps me to focus, calm my nerves and clear my mind. There is usually a short briefing at the start line from the race organiser and then the runners head off. What do you need to remember? Don't go off too fast!</p>
<p>Before you even start warming up for the race, you need to register and get into your racing kit with your bumbag and all its contents ready for the start. Bearing this in mind, get to the start nice and early if you can. If you're smart, you'll have double checked the kit requirements with the race organiser (either by calling them or through checking their web site/entry form) and brought everything you need to avoid any last minute panics. As with any type of running event, you'll need to have left plenty of time since you last ate to make sure food is fully digested (I tend to breakfast on a couple of high-carb energy bars three hours before the start) and have been to the loo before the race. I mention that last rather obvious point because many races don't have facilities at the start - you may need to stop at a toilet down the road before you arrive.</p>
<p>Most races don't provide any water on the course, and for shorter races you just need to be properly hydrated when you get there. If you are sure you need a drink during the race, you'll to carry it yourself.</p>

<div class="section" id="some-easy-mistakes-to-avoid">
<h3>Some easy mistakes to avoid</h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>He looks like he knows where he's going, I'll follow him....</li>
</ol>
<p>A classic mistake....either trust your map skills, recce the route in advance or choose a race where the route is easy to follow. Following other runners like a sheep will work some of the time, but not all the time.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>I'm good on hills so I'll go fast on the climbs...</li>
</ol>
<p>That might leave you with nothing left for the descents, which make up half the race.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>The weather looks good, I won't bother taking my jacket...</li>
</ol>
<p>The organiser may have seen a different weather forecast, or for some other reason may insist on you carrying full kit.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>I'll try this new energy drink , it might give me a boost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless it's a long race, stick to water. In an endurance event only use what you've tried out in training. The rigours of fell running make life hard for the digestive system so it's best to avoid any chance of upsetting things.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-finally">
<h3>And finally.......</h3>
<p>So that's it - the training will prepare you in terms of fitness and learning to cope with the conditions. The race will give you a great opportunity to put all your learning into practise and compete alongside others who love running on the fells. The real competition is against your own limits - the competition of "<a class="reference" href="http://uk.srichinmoyraces.org/resources/manatita">Self-Transcendence</a> " - so even if you come last, if you gave it your all, that's an achievement in itself. Good luck, and (for the last time) don't go off too fast!</p>

<p class="documentDescription">New York - Seventy-five-year-old fitness champion and global harmony leader, Sri Chinmoy, has lifted airplanes, huge boulders, a car, a giant pumpkin and 2002 World’s Strongest Man Hugo Girard of Canada—for a total weight of 111,524 pounds. Battling age and injuries during a non-stop three-day lifting marathon, Sri Chinmoy has achieved “the most amazing feats of strength” he has ever seen—according to 5-time Mr. Universe and fitness expert Bill Pearl who witnessed all the lifts.</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>The extraordinary demonstration of strength, which was also seen by hundreds of people present from around the world, illustrates Sri Chinmoy’s dedication to what he calls “the unlimited potential of the human spirit.” Bill Pearl exclaimed: “75-year-old, 175-pound Sri Chinmoy does the most amazing feats of strength that I have ever seen, regardless of his age and regardless of his size. This is just a very small example of what this gentleman can do with mind over matter.”</p>

<p>Using innovative weightlifting machines that allow Sri Chinmoy to lift human beings and other objects using standard exercises, Sri Chinmoy lifted 350-pound Hugo Girard more than10 times and pressed weights on 21 different weight machines, each utilising different muscles of his arms, legs, chest, and shoulders.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy performed several feats of strength during one of bodybuilding’s top contests of the year, the Night of Champions at Town Hall in New York City, including lifting Hugo and Bill Pearl together in a seated calf raise and lifting event organisers Wayne DeMilia and Charles Blake using his shoulder muscles!</p>

<p>During the Night of Champions event, Mr. DeMilia presented Sri Chinmoy with the Night of Champions Award, citing his “feats of strength that have blazed new pathways of self-transcendence, amazing and inspiring the sports world and securing him a unique place of honour amongst the weightlifting galaxy of immortals.”</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy lifted three different Piper and Baron airplanes at Princeton Airport filled with passengers in New Jersey a total of five times, as well as huge boulders at the nearby Rock Museum—all using his calf muscles.</p>

<h2>I Am Grateful</h2>
<br/>
I am grateful to my Beloved Supreme, for out of His infinite Bounty He has given me the capacity to love Him more than I love myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am grateful to my Beloved Supreme, for out of His infinite Bounty He has given me the capacity to feel His Need more than my own need.<br/>
<br/>
I am grateful to my Beloved Supreme, for out of His infinite Bounty He has given me the capacity not to drag Him into my desire-world, but to implore His Presence in my aspiration-world, and also to offer Him my earth-bound will and desire-life, and soulfully declare, "Let Thy Will be done."<br/>
<br/>
I shall be extremely grateful to my Beloved Supreme the day He makes me a chosen instrument of His.<br/>
<br/>
I shall be extremely, extremely grateful to my Beloved Supreme the day I can feel that my soul-bird lives only for Him inside my body-cage here on earth and there in Heaven. I shall be extremely, extremely and extremely grateful to my Beloved Supreme the day I can declare to the world within and to the world without that I am what He has and I have what He is.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>I Am Privileged</h2>
<br/>
I am privileged that God has granted me a human incarnation. It is only in the human life that I can realise Him, reveal Him and manifest Him unreservedly and unconditionally.<br/>
<br/>
I am privileged that ignorance-dream does not dare to intimidate me, because it sees God and God's constant Protection around me.<br/>
<br/>
I am privileged that my heart loves my Lord Supreme infinitely more than my mind can ever imagine.<br/>
<br/>
I am privileged that my Lord Supreme Himself has asked me to offer Him a silent prayer and a soulful meditation early in the morning before I enter into the hustle and bustle of life. My silent prayer is this: "O Lord Supreme, do accept my surrender-life." My soulful meditation is this: "O Lord Supreme, do enter into my gratitude-heart and remain seated there."<br/>
<br/>
I am privileged that my Lord Supreme discusses His Cosmic Plans with me in Heaven, and I am privileged that He has made me a faithful representative of His to execute His Will here on earth.<br/>
<br/>
I am privileged that at every moment God loves me more than I deserve, He speaks to me more than I deserve, He gives me more than I deserve. In every way He does things for me, says things to me and dreams in and through me infinitely more than I shall ever deserve.<br/>
<br/>
I am privileged that I fully and soulfully claim Him as my own, very own, my own Eternity's own.<br/>

<h2>Who Is The Winner?</h2>
<br/>
Who is the winner? Not he who wins, but he who has established his cheerful oneness with the result, which is an experience in the form of failure or success, a journey forward or a journey backward.<br/>
<br/>
Who is the winner? Not he who wins the race, but he who loves to run sleeplessly and breathlessly with God the supreme Runner.<br/>
<br/>
Who is the winner? Not he whose glory we sing, but he who embodies God's Compassion-Light in abundant measure.<br/>
<br/>
Who is the winner? Not he who has acquired tremendous name and fame and amassed a big fortune, but he who requires only one thing: God-satisfaction in God's own way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Am I A Giver?</h2>
<br/>
Am I a giver? Yes I am. Am I a cheerful and soulful giver? No, unfortunately I am not. That means I am offering not only my rose but also many, many thorns along with it.<br/>
<br/>
Am I a giver? Yes I am. Am I a cheerful and soulful giver? No, unfortunately I am not. That means I am offering not only my hope-world but also my frustration-world along with it.<br/>
<br/>
Am I a giver? Yes I am. Am I a cheerful and soulful giver? No, unfortunately I am not. That means I am offering not only my aspiration-free world but also my desire-bound world to all those who are around me.<br/>
<br/>
How can I become a cheerful and soulful giver in order to liberate myself and liberate others? I can become a cheerful and soulful giver provided I can feel that a giver is he who is also a receiver. The greater a giver he is, the better a receiver he becomes. He gives because he feels that that is the only way to please the real in him, the soul. The real giver gives to the world his soul’s all-illumining beauty cheerfully and soulfully, and never, never does he give his body’s ugliness-dream.<br/>

            <div class="documentBody"><tt>– April 10 and 15, 2006, N.Y.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>It has been an old dream of mine to celebrate something with climbing,</tt> <tt>a concentration and strength-sport activity that matches effort with</tt> <tt>fun. To celebrate the 42nd anniversary of our spiritual tutor's arrival</tt> <tt>to the West, Charita, Dharmaputri, Elke and I decided to climb 42</tt> <tt>climbing routes. Since it was the closest to our N.Y. headquarters, and</tt> <tt>also because on the first day the weather wasn't nice at all, we drove</tt> <tt>to an indoor climbing centre on Long Island.</tt><br/>
<div class="c3"/>

<br/>
<tt>((((For the sake of the non-initiated ones: by indoor routes I mean</tt> <tt>vertical routes, basically sets of coloured hand and footholds</tt> <tt>specially designed and screwed on (almost) vertical and overhanging</tt> <tt>walls. There are routes of various difficulty degree (the degrees are</tt> <tt>numbered differently on the different continents), according to how</tt> <tt>many and how big or how ”easy-to-hold-on-to” these grips are. There may</tt> <tt>be several routes built on the same section of the wall, it is their</tt> <tt>colour or the colour of the stripe underneath that distinguishes one</tt> <tt>route from another. Once you start climbing one of them, you may touch</tt> <tt>holds of that colour only.</tt> <tt>For safety reasons climbers use ropes and special belaying devices. In</tt> <tt>this case, three of us travelling from another continent with an</tt> <tt>already big luggage, we had not had much gear with us, except for our</tt> <tt>harnesses, shoes and chalk bags (chalk being needed to prevent our</tt> <tt>sweaty hands from slipping off the small or rounded holds). Therefore</tt> <tt>we could only use the ropes and gri-gris (a belaying device that blocks</tt> <tt>the rope in case the climber falls) pre-installed and did only</tt> <tt>top-roping (the rope comes from above, one end of it being attached to</tt> <tt>the climber's harness, while its other end being held end pulled in or</tt> <tt>fed out through a gri-gri by the belaying person; it is considered that</tt> <tt>easiest and safest way). ))))</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Participants include (in alphabetical order): Charita (the young spider</tt> <tt>of El Salvador, a particularly talented beginner with very nice, light,</tt> <tt>long and wide moves), Dharmaputri (the tough lady of the Swiss Alps and</tt> <tt>Mont Blanc, conqueror of many alpine summits including some north</tt> <tt>faces), Elke W. (who has thus made a successful return to the climbing</tt> <tt>world she left some years ago with very good results in her bag –</tt> <tt>routes of degree 7a-c on the European scale) and my humble self,</tt> <tt>Kamalika (a not particularly remarkable climber if a climber at all,</tt> <tt>but definitely a great lover of the altitudes and of the vertical world</tt> <tt>regardless of whether it consists of rock, of the compressed ice of a</tt> <tt>glacier or of the frozen ice of a waterfall).</tt><br/>
<br/>

<a href="http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/gallery/members/kamalika/The_42_climbs_project/">(click for more photos...)</a><br/></div>
<br/>
<tt>The first occasion three of us climbed (”on-sight”) 6 routes each. The</tt> <tt>second occasion Dharmaputri joined us and again we had to climb 6</tt> <tt>routes each in order to have 42 all together. Of course we transcended</tt> <tt>this a bit. Also, the other three girls did a bit of difficult</tt> <tt>bouldering, but we did not count those shorter but much harder boulder</tt> <tt>routes.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>We are fully conscious that none of the climbs illustrated here would</tt> <tt>make a headline in the alpine or climbing magazines, nevertheless we</tt> <tt>sweated a lot, we had great fun and all of us made more or less</tt> <tt>progress in improving our technique and style. Actually that was the</tt> <tt>point in doing it, with these climbs we lived what Sri Chinmoy teaches</tt> <tt>us: improve yourself, transcend yourself, do not compete with others</tt> <tt>but with yourself – and be happy.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>I hope to be able to say that this was a pilot-project (testing the</tt> <tt>thing) and now that we saw that IT WORKS, it will be followed by more.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Gratitude,</tt><br/>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Most of the climbing “scene” in Macedonia at</tt> <tt>this moment is concentrated in the capital, Skopje, and many</tt> <tt>foreign climbers passing through the country mostly stay there, so I</tt> <tt>should first mention the local climbing area in Skopje, called Matka.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Matka is a canyon on the river Treska situated only 30 minutes drive</tt> <tt>from Skopje. This is a very special place where in the past</tt> <tt>there were thriving orthodox monasteries and the silent prayers of</tt> <tt>the monks enchanted the entire area with eternal peace. Now there is</tt> <tt>only one working monastery, but the churches dotted everywhere around</tt> <tt>still spread the calming vibration throughout the area.<br/></tt></span></p>

Also, because of the limestone character of</tt> <tt>the area there are many unusual caves can be found that are subject of</tt> <tt>research by local and international speleology teams, not to mention</tt> <tt>the great possibilities for hiking... But for me the most important</tt> <tt>thing is the rock jutting upwards about 200 metres high. The</tt> <tt>rock is limestone and very unstable and fragile, yet this is where we</tt> <tt>all made our first steps in the climbing world and it is very dear to</tt> <tt>us. There are many routes of four or five pitches and a also few</tt> <tt>sport-climbing playgrounds, the closest of which is very near to the</tt> <tt>hut (which is only 10 minutes walk from the parking lot); the rest are</tt> <tt>not so very far from the hut either.<br/>

<tt>The whole climbing “scene” in the coutnry is in a period of</tt> <tt>“awakening”</tt> <tt>and the local climbers are working on the revival of these and other</tt> <tt>areas: for example, Ostra Karpa, with its granite rock and the frozen</tt> <tt>waterfalls in the very scenic mountains in the</tt> <tt>western part of the country….

<p class="c9"><span class="c8">- In Chamonix</span><br/></p>
<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Not having much time however, we decided to go to the mountains the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">very next day. In the morning we sorted out our gear, calculating what</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route we would do and how much we should take in our backpacks without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overloading them, before heading towards the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Aiguille du Midi Teleferique Station. After a fascinating ride which</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">took in a view towards the north face of this needlelike mountain where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we could see all the fine details of it, we arrived at the tunnels on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the top with a big group of tourists that wanted to have a closer look</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">towards Mont Blanc…<br/>
<br/></span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Here in the tunnels, there is an exit that leads down towards Valee</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Blanche. This exit is marked with all those 'Danger' red and yellow</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fluorescent signs and fences that warn 'other' people not to go there</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">without a guide or proper equipment. As we were putting on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">crampons and preparing the ice-axes under the close scrutiny of the</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>tourists, I felt like this exit was like a door of a plane and we were</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">getting ready to jump out of it with our parachutes on – the light that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ent</span></tt><tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">rs into these dark tunnels from outside is very bright and it</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">really feels like going into the unknown from that point on… Anyway –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we put on our helmets and glasses and we stepped out. I felt much</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">better here…</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
There was a very distinct path going down into the valley; there were</tt> <tt>surprisingly few people on it. I thought</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">that this was probably because of the warning that was posted in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the information office of Chamonix saying that because of the bad</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">weather</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(too</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">warm) there were many new big crevasses opened up in the mountains</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made even the normal routes a little complicated to pass… This is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a popular place where many guides from all around Europe go with their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">clients and probably they decided that it was not safe for the time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">to take someone inexperienced. We came down and put our tent in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“big white” and there were about 10 more tents there scattered around…<br/>
<br/></span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>There was a really nice view here – we could see the summits of du</tt> <tt>Midi, du Tacul, Jorasses in the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">distance... But the sun was really warming up the place and all of a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sudden the silence was interpreted with the crash of a stonefall down</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">North Face Triangle of du Tacul. We turned our heads immediately when</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we heard the sound and we could see the big rocks falling down towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">foot of the face followed by a cloud of dust.

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>That night we decided to go towards Mont Blanc (4848m) over du Tacul</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">and Mont Maudit (4465m). We didn’t have any acclimatization, but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we didn’t feel any problems at all going over du Tacul and climbing</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt>towards Mont Maudit. But we had a late start and the weather was</tt> <tt>getting warmer and warmer… We came to a point on Maudit where there</tt> <tt>was</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">a 70meters high almost vertical piece of climbing to get on the ridge</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of this mountain after which some easy hiking of 2-3 hours was left to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">gain Mont Blanc. On the way up we met few parties returning from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">top and when we came to this point, we waited for another 2 parties to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">rappel down since it was a narrow path leading to a safe belay stance</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on a piece of rock… Climbing towards it was really scary. By that time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was almost climbing in shorts and was over 4000m altitude in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Alps</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which at least for me was surprising… But when I started climbing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">real problem showed up. Under the very fragile vertical ice I could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hear water running down the vertical slope… The ice could break at any</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">moment, my intuition was telling me that we should go back and I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">shouted out to Vesna that I was climbing down so that she could belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">me properly. When I came back on safer ground we sat down, had</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">something to eat and drink and decided to have a try the next day.</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>

The next day we actually decided to relax and go on the SSW</tt> <tt>“Cosmiques”</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Ridge of Aiguille du Midi.

Although it is recommended as an “introduction to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Alpine mixed climbing” (in the book “Mont Blanc Massif – Selected</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbs”) on the whole way up because of the very warm weather we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed on snow only for about ten meters on the traverse where the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">short rock wall starts before we got on the viewing platforms…</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">It was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">easy climbing with nice views towards Chamonix on one side and Valee</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Blanche on the other.</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
Arriving on the platform is done over a stair that ends right on the</tt> <tt>middle of the platform where most of the tourists are. Getting on the</tt> <tt>platform roped up together with our equipment hanging from our</tt> <tt>harnesses was really hard for us. To the tourists on the platform, it</tt> <tt>was like we had fallen from another planet, everyone was turning on</tt> <tt>their cameras to take a picture… We wanted to get out of there as soon</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">as possible and be back safe down in the valley. Just when we arrived</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">at</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the exit for the valley and thought we are safe a small group of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Japanese tourists surrounded us excited about the opportunity to have</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a picture with us… They were really happy exclaiming all the time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“...you are brave men…” When I was out in the snow away from all that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">noise I felt very happy about it.</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>

During the night we were awakened a few times with a roaring noise</tt> <tt>like the mountain was falling apart. It was thunder; I had a quick look</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">out of the tent towards the sky but the sky looked clear somehow… At</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">around 2 o’clock am we started getting ready again and this time we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could see only about 10 people ahead of us. The weather was the reason</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">for this since the skies now looked dark. After some time, just when</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">were crossing the last crevasse, a climber came alone and asked if he</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">can join our rope. He was a good Spanish fellow who had a problem of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">waking up his partner so he started out alone but felt unsafe at the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">crevasse barrier… We accepted him and continued. It was totally</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">different from 2 days previously. When we gained the highest point of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridge of du Tacul we were not able to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see anything from that point on.<br/></span></tt></p>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt><br/>
It was like gray curtain… Everyone was making a short 30minutes walk</tt> <tt>toward the summit of this mountain and going down. We did the same and</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">about that time the weather started to get much worse. It was snowing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">heavily and going down the steep track was tricky. We were roped all</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">together - Vesna going as first, I was in the middle and our Spanish</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friend (I have trouble remembering names) was last. Suddenly I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">heard a strange noise and out of the corner of my eye I saw</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">him sliding down the steep slope; I instantly screamed to Vesna to get</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down and drive her ice axe as fast as she could into the snow as I did</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">same; after two or three seconds there was a small jerk on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">rope but it stopped at that point. It all happened so quickly but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">luckily the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">slope was not so steep and the ice was not that frozen so the fall was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stopped without any bigger consequences. Needless to say, after this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">incident he was most grateful to us for accepting him in the party! The</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">weather was getting worse and worse and when we came down in the valley</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we felt a very strong wind that almost ripped off our tent… With great</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulty we packed the tent, packed everything in our backpacks and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">headed towards the telepherique. There were no tourists there now -</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only us and a few other climbers. As we arrived in Chamonix the weather</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was partly</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cloudy and it looked like there was a storm approaching from</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the surrounding mountains.

            <p class="documentDescription">...Mission Gorge bouldering and climbing</p>
<div class="documentBody">A few years ago I visited the nice city of San Diego where the local Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team was organizing the annual <a href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/us/races/san_diego_swim__run/">Self-Transcendence Swim&amp;Run</a>. Those few weeks in the company of very hospitable Californians were a most memorable experience and something I will definitely never forget.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the beautiful beach and surroundings where the race was held, the thing I remember most was the incongruity between the amount of sport activities taking place and the hot weather. Fiding some shade in San Diego was a real adventure but it never stopped us running, playing soccer or ultimate frisbee and of course doing some climbing and bouldering. We did some climbing indoors in the Vertial Hold Climbing Gym - I had read that this was the largest climbing hall in Southern California and was anxious too see it... It is just a fraciton of the size of the hall I visited in Zurich, Switzerland but I had a lots of fun climbing there with my friend Atulya.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/kar"/>   <img src="http://ig.srichinmoyraces.org/"/>   <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/top"/>   <img src="http://at.srichinmoyraces.org/"/><br/></div>
<br/>
We also did some bouldering and climbing in the Mission Trails Regional Park in the Mission Gorge climbing area. I will never forget my first experience of climbing there - it was my first time in "desert" conditions. There was a nice breeze but temperatures were still high. We took off our t-shirts and of course went home with red and painful backs. We went there a few times and had a lot of fun doing some unnamed, unrated (at least for us - we didn't care about that) bouldering problems just for pure joy. The granite rock was a welcome contrast to the limestone/conglomerate I usually climb on and I really liked making some fun moves on the flakes of these rocks...<br/>
<br/>
This happened three or four years ago. A recent reunion with Atulya in New York brought it back to mind when we both witnessed our spiritual teacher, <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>, perform a <a href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/athletic_achievements/256lbwristcurl">256lb wrist curl</a> in each arm and a 740lb double arm lift. Sri Chinmoy tries through weightlifting to inspire his fellow man to greater things. This reunion inspired me to write about the fond memories I had with the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team from San Diego with hope to visit them soon...<br/>
