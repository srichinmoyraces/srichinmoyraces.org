Parking anywhere near the Robertson Rd gates. On-the-day registration opens at 6.45 am and closes at 7.55 am, with races starting from 8 am.</p>

<div class="documentBody">
<p><tt><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK">While <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>'s students have run ultramarathons, swum the</span></tt> <span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>English Channel and broken world endurance records in numerous</tt> <tt>fields, one feat of endurance has so far eluded them: climbing Mount</tt> <tt>Everest. If one intrepid group has its way, however, this might be</tt> <tt>next on the list.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Of course, it will be no small achievement. Though more people have</tt><tt>climbed Everest over the past 50 years than have swum the Channel,</tt> <tt>the height of 8,850 metres (29,035 feet) still seems an almost</tt> <tt>mythical quest (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/high14">The Highest 14...</a>).</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>One of the most experienced climbers on the team is New Yorker</tt> <tt>Anugata B., who has swum the Channel, completed several</tt> <tt>ultramarathon races, and run across the Sahara Desert. "I think the</tt> <tt>Channel gave me the confidence to climb mountains," he says.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Though he swam the Channel back in 1988, mountain-climbing had</tt> <tt>intrigued him since his childhood, when he was watching National</tt> <tt>Geographic specials on TV. "I remember one in particular where they</tt> <tt>were climbing the Alps. I think it was Walker Spur. I remember being</tt> <tt>absolutely floored by watching it. I wasn't saying at the time that</tt> <tt>I wanted to do that, but it really struck a chord inside of me."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Here, he reveals his techniques for what might yet be his greatest</tt> <tt>achievement â techniques which have their basis in his spiritual</tt> <tt>life.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Play to your body's strengths</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>Part of his interest in mountain-climbing, he says, is due to his</tt> <tt>body's physical traits. "My physical body's made for endurance, as</tt> <tt>opposed to high-intensity sports like sprinting or even high-level</tt> <tt>rock climbing."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Climb with friends who have the same goal</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>These climbers were already long-time friends. "We've all been <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri</a></tt> <tt><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Chinmoy</a>'s meditation students for a very long time, on average about</tt> <tt>25 years," says Anugata, "so we were meditating and pursuing other</tt> <tt>sports well before the four of us ever started climbing.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"We realised we had a similar goal: to climb a high mountain, and to</tt> <tt>really experience the atmosphere and the consciousness of the</tt> <tt>mountain. Especially the Himalayas, because it's the traditional</tt> <tt>seat of meditation for yogis who meditate in caves.</tt> <tt>The combination of the sporting life and the spiritual life, in an</tt> <tt>environment like that, is really, really satisfying."</tt><br/>

<tt>Anugata meditates every day. "The actual act of meditation â sitting</tt> <tt>down and really silencing your mind, that real inner stillness â is</tt> <tt>not so easy. At least, not for long periods of time, given the</tt> <tt>intense activity of the Western lifestyle. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has always</tt> <tt>used athletics to augment the meditative experience."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Anugata and his friends see mountain-climbing as a spiritual</tt> <tt>experience. Take their expedition to Mount Cho Oyu, which is near</tt> <tt>Everest. At 8,201 metres (26,906 feet), it is the world's sixth</tt> <tt>highest peak (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/high14">The Highest 14...</a>).</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"We had a puja [ceremony] before we started. We meditated at base</tt> <tt>camp every day. We tried to make it a pilgrimage, not just an</tt> <tt>'attack' on the mountain â a word that some people use. We were in</tt> <tt>Tibet, and we really wanted to feel our oneness with Tibet, with the</tt> <tt>villages and people, and just continue that feeling right up the</tt> <tt>mountain. We didn't have any porters or any help climbing. It was</tt> <tt>just four of us â and our cooks, down at base camp. We all made it</tt> <tt>to the top.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"The consciousness up at the top, when you're walking around with</tt> <tt>low oxygen, is just not earthly. It's more like being in an</tt> <tt>airliner, when you look out the window in the morning, except</tt> <tt>there's no plane. Living in that environment for several weeks, it</tt><br/>
<tt>was really easy to meditate out there."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Build up to your goal</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>The same advice applies to almost everything. Anugata has taken many</tt> <tt>years, with several sub-goals on his way to the main one.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"If you're mountaineering, it's not a question of just bagging a</tt> <tt>peak, then going home and telling people what you did. That's</tt> <tt>probably part of it, but you've got to pay your dues, just like</tt> <tt>anything in life. You have to decide this is a priority and go about</tt> <tt>it in a conscious way. If you want to climb higher altitudes, like</tt> <tt>the 8000-foot peaks, start at lower altitudes and work up.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"I'd been climbing about 12 years at that point, maybe two or three</tt> <tt>trips a year. I was just practising in and around New York, or going</tt> <tt>to South America or China or Alaska. The four of us had done various</tt> <tt>things that led us to believe that we could handle this 8000-metre</tt> <tt>climb in low oxygen.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"First you learn how to handle the altitude and perhaps take care of</tt> <tt>yourself. You have to be prepared for what happens with the weather</tt> <tt>â unexpected storms and things like that. You have to be prepared</tt> <tt>for the incredible cold at 8000 metres. That cold is really due to</tt> <tt>the lack of oxygen. When you get up between 7000 metres and 8000</tt> <tt>metres, there's not much oxygen in your body. It's not burning and</tt> <tt>producing a lot of heat, so you have these down suits and a lot of</tt> <tt>insulation. You have to be very careful to take care of your</tt> <tt>appendages â your hands, your nose, your toes. So that's another</tt> <tt>aspect of being prepared.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"There's a little bit of technical climbing, and as you soon as you</tt> <tt>progress high enough and start to do vertical rock climbing, it's</tt> <tt>really a heavy-duty thing. It really comes from meditationâ¦ without</tt> <tt>letting any negative emotion get in there, and just for the moment,</tt> <tt>always being the best that you can be. That's going to be,</tt><br/>
<tt>ultimately, your best achievement.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"Half of mountaineering is taking care of yourself. You can't really</tt> <tt>expect someone, even if it's your guide, to come up to you at every</tt> <tt>moment and say, 'How ya doing?' They may say that, but you might not</tt> <tt>be able to tell them how it really is going. It's really important</tt> <tt>to pay into the sport, but responsibly â I want to stress the word</tt><br/>
<tt>'responsibly' â get to the point where you can climb at that level."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt class="c6">Make climbing part of your life-philosophy</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>"When you spend a long time in an activity, you tend to get inside</tt> <tt>the activity and inside yourself," Anugata says. "You just have more</tt> <tt>time to let the higher experience happen."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>However, this should happen naturally. The activity itself comes</tt> <tt>first. "It's become a philosophy as I've gotten older, but I think</tt> <tt>philosophy starts as something you just do physically. The</tt> <tt>philosophy gets built around it.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"In a zen sense, you get into the actual activity. Visiting</tt> <tt>remote places, the pure living out in the mountain drinking the</tt> <tt>glacier water, is just something that you feel satisfied doing. If</tt> <tt>you get to the summit of the peaks that you want to, that's a plus."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Prepare yourself for the power of the mountain</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>"It's easy to get a magazine about climbing and get some pictures of</tt> <tt>the people on Everest or one of the other 8000-metre peaks. You see</tt> <tt>people climbing, but what you don't get is the tremendous vibration</tt> <tt>of the place, which is really soulful.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>In that area of the world â Tibet, Nepal and Pakistan â where the</tt> <tt>really high mountains are, you get this feeling of tremendous power</tt> <tt>in the atmosphere. It's almost tangible. At the same time, you're</tt> <tt>feeling this inner strength. But the physical body is really</tt> <tt>struggling. You look at photos of people climbingâ¦ but you don't</tt> <tt>really get a feeling of what they're experiencing."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>When you follow in their footsteps, of course, it all becomes clear.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"You see that you're made up of various elements. You're not just</tt> <tt>the body. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has always taught us that there's the physical</tt> <tt>body, the vital energy, the mental energy, the heart power and the</tt> <tt>soul's power, and you start to see that separation when you get into</tt> <tt>very difficult athletic situations. The great art of meditation</tt> <tt>helps to clarify what's going on."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Do it with the greatest motives</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>This is an experience to be savoured â not just reaching the goal,</tt> <tt>but every part of the activity. "If you don't really enjoy it,</tt> <tt>there's not a great chance that you'll get to the top, because</tt> <tt>you're talking about a couple of months of approach and climbing,</tt> <tt>and there's definitely hardship involved."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>But while the activity might be difficult, Anugata says, enjoying it</tt> <tt>is a simple task. "The Everest climb might not even be your highest</tt> <tt>moment. Personally, I've had many of my own greatest moments. Many</tt> <tt>of them are not on the top of the mountain. Some of them are side</tt> <tt>issues to the climb. You can never tell when that moment of grace is</tt> <tt>going to descend on you. You're looking at the world with a new set</tt> <tt>of eyes.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"Getting ready, and taking the responsible steps to climb in the</tt> <tt>Himalayas, is just part of that. It's a whole path. We have a</tt> <tt>meditative path, and this is another path that is built around the</tt> <tt>meditative path.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"It's more about trying to see God within the world. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>'s</tt> <tt>philosophy is that he tries to see God's existence within the world.</tt> <tt>To get a glimpse of that is to get a foothold in that awareness. It</tt> <tt>requires us to try to silence ourselves, and get insight into what</tt> <tt>we are doing."</tt><br/>

            <p class="documentDescription">18/19 September 2004 - North Face of Aiguille du Midi by the route "Frendo Spur"</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<h3>Climbing up the North Face of Aiguille du Midi</h3>
<br/>
The many visitors that make the pilgrimage to the famous ski resort of Chamonix, France only have to look high up in the surrounding mountains to see the North Face of Aiguille du Midi. A short trip by lift gives them a unique opportunity to see every detail of all the major climbing routes, and sometimes one can even make out on the rockface the tiny spots of the climbers in action. During last yearâs Alpine trip, I beheld the north face of Aiguille du Midi, and since then whoever asked me my plans for the next season was told emphatically that I want to go on Frendo, the imposing buttress that rises up almost straight through the middle of the big wall of Midi.<br/>
<br/>
The buttress is named after the Frendo-Rionda party, who did the first ascent by this route on 11 July 1941, followed twenty-three years later by the first winter ascent by the Stagni-Wohlschlag party on 21-22 January 1964. Our climb began on the seventeenth of September, 2004, when myself and my climbing partner, Ekalabhya, took what we needed for this climb up on to the glacier where we wanted to camp in order to have an early start the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/our route"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- The route</span><br/></div>
<br/>
I had spent all year reading as many descriptions as I could findÂ  about the route, looking at some pictures, dreaming about it constantly - I thought that I knew everything there was to know. Maybe I did, but no amount of reading could have prepared me for that moment during our approach to the glacier when the true size of the task ahead dawned on me. 1200 meters of near-vertical rock face awaited us, starting up around 2600m and ending at the 3842 meters high summit. It was such an intimidating sight, and many times during our approach we had to avert our eyes as the the whole thing just became too mind-boggling. Everything that I thought I knew had just gone out the window. It was only when we set up our âbase campâ and became occupied with the mundane jobs such as melting water that our anxiety went away and we could look at the route objectively, discussing matters such as where we could go faster and where we might have problems.<br/>
<br/>
We didnât start particularly early the next morning and it wasnt untill 8:00am that we arrived under the rock itself, after a one-hour approach from our tent. The bergschrund (crevasse between the face and the glacier) was quite big and there was only one place were we could easily go on the rock. Up until now we had been quite calm and collected, but now we could see the true size of the rock features now that we were up close, and I was overwhelmed by the magnitude of it all. The north faces of the Alps are very cold during the whole day. At the beginning every touch on the rock was very uncomfortable but we were concentrating only on the climbing itself and after some time we forgot about the cold.<br/>
<br/>
We were climbing without any rest stops, trying to make our first bivouac place as high as possible, bearing in mind the last lift down from the mountain the next day left at 5:00pm. We didnât have any problems finding our way on the rock - there was only one real route up, along the ridge, on either side of which there were only abysses and hold less slabs. From time to time we would find some leftovers from other climbing parties: cams, nuts, slings, a few pitonsâ¦<br/>
<br/>
The only problem was to get higher. But, not having acclimatized at all, we were moving increasingly more slowly the higher we ascended. Just before it got dark, we came under a vertical pillar that was raising four or five rope lengths up. We decided to sleep there,as we were unsure as to whether there was any better place to sleep further on. The sleep wasn't brilliant, to say the least. It got to the point when we would wake up because of the cold, wriggle around to warm up enough to go back to sleep, only to wake up again, and again...<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, the buttress rising up right in front of us did not seem half as scary as it was when we approached it from the glacier the day before. We knew where we should go, so we went. From that moment on the technical difficulty level of the climb was raised a notch or two and there was one or two times I really regretted not bringing my climbing shoes with me instead of the big plastic boots that I had. But once we started to encounter the parts with snow, I was more glad I brought my boots. We had been climbing for what seemed like ages and yet we still couldnât see the start of the section where the rockface become covered completely in snow and ice. We changed the lead for what seemed like countless times. Finally we came to the snow arÃªte where we could put on our crampons. From there we could see the station at the summit and we were confident that we would make it there before five oâclock. But it did not happen that way...<br/>
<br/>
In all the descriptions that I read, there was almost nothing written about the first two thirds of the route; it was this ice-arÃªte that took all their attention, and when they were writing about the ice-arÃªte you got the impression they were really inspired. And I couldsee why. The arÃªte was so steep on both sides that we were basically crawling on it a few steps at time. The only way that we could belay ourselves was that if one of us were to fall the other one was supposed to jump down the other side of the arÃªte! On the both sides abysses led down to the rocks and from there to the glacier 900 meters below. Understandably, we were very cautious.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/ice"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- Igor starting the lead on the ice</span><br/></div>
<br/>
At one point we started traversing to the right because we wanted to go around the rognon- the rock that stretched all the way to the top. There we climbed on ice belaying with ice-screws. It was dark and the ice slope grew steeper as we went up. At one point when it was my turn to belay Ekalabhya to come to me, the slope was so steep I couldnât stand normally and I had to hang on the ice-screws. We were joking that it was good that it was dark we would probably be not so relaxed if we could see where we were.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, we were only climbing and climbing, undisturbed by the height, the steepness, what lay to the right or left of us; only the cold disturbed us. I would climb to my stance and shiver uncontrollably whilst I was waiting for Ekalabhya to come to me and continue climbing another rope-length. When I saw my gloves frozen solid, I just had to laugh at the situation we were in.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Ekalabhya about the time and he said that it was exactly midnight. From then on, we continued climbing in silence. We just wanted to reach the end. We reached an area laden with crevasses. I was supposed to lead that part; I pointed the light of my headlamp in all directions but I couldnât see any logical way to go. In the end, I just picked a direction and went because I didnât want to stay in one place too long. I was climbing through very nice forms of ice with some crevasses to one side. When I reached my stance it was such a position that I thought that there is no way back and that we had to push straight. I couldnât really see what was up there in the dark but I could see the lights at the summit. When Ekalabhya came and continued I could see from his light that we were very close to the top alright but his movements also showed me how bad the terrain was. When my turn came to start up I could see that I was right. The last two rope-lengths were full of hidden crevasses but Ekalabhya did a great job leading the way through and over them.<br/>
<br/>
At last, we reached the summit ridge and I could recognize the terrain. The track for the âWhite Valleyâ was going down on the other side and we were only a few minutes walk away to the tunnels of the Midi station.<br/>
<br/>
It was 3:00am when we arrived there. We had been climbing for 30 hours, 18 hours during the second day alone. After five hours we were on the glacier again, collecting our leftover gear and the tent, and happily looking back on route above us; this time our original apprehension had been replaced with a sense of satisfaction at a job well done.<br/>
<br/>
The climb was dedicated with gratitude to <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>.<br/></div>
