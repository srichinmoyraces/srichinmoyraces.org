<meta name="description" content="Craig Virgin (American 10,000 m champion, twice World Cross-Country champion, 2:10 marathoner) Question: How do I cope with the pressure of winning or, on the other hand, the disappointment of losing, in a sports competition? Sri Chinmoy: You can cope with the pressure of winning if, a few days before the race or even just before the start, you can imagine the pleasure of rejoicing in your victory. Imagination is not wishful thinking; it is not a baseless reality. Imagination is reality itself in another world. We bring it down to this world the way we bring down fruits from a tree. To cope with the disappointment of losing, you have to ask yourself whether the mind is disappointed or the heart is disappointed. You will realise that it is your mind that is disappointed and not your heart. The mind creates division; the mind is division itself, and division is another name for pain, devastating pain. The heart, on the other hand, creates oneness; in fact, the heart is oneness itself, and oneness is another name for joy, spontaneous joy. When you live in your heart, even if your worst rival wins the race, you will not feel miserable. To your wide surprise, you will find that his joy quite unconsciously and unexpectedly will enter into you and widen your heart. Then you will feel almost the same joy that the winner feels. Eammon Coghlan (Ireland, Olympic Finalist in 1500 m, 1976 and 1980 in each case 4th place; world-record holder for the indoor mile) Question: Given an Olympic final, ten competitors are lined up in the race. All are 100% physically fit and prepared. What does it take for one runner to win over the others? Sri Chinmoy: It is not just a matter of luck as to who wins, for there are two ways to become a winner: one way is to concentrate on each runner and, like a magnet, draw into oneself the will power that each one has and almost empty them of their will power or life energy. This is called sheer determination-power. The determination-lion devours the weaker animals. The other way is to identify oneself with the sources of the fastest speed and endurance. Here one consciously becomes one with the higher realities that are invisible, yet infinitely faster and stronger than the outer realities or the outer capacities. If a runner is a conscious Truth-seeker and God-lover, then he will adopt the inner way and not the outer way. The outer way is the way of the lion: roaring and devouring the rivals. Don Kardon (USA, President of the Association of Road Racing Athletes; 4th place in the 1976 Olympics marathon in Montreal) Question: Why do you think runners are often able to achieve a kind of meditative state while running? Sri Chinmoy: Concentration and meditation are members of the same family. When a runner focuses all his attention on a particular race, he is in a position to free his mind from uncomely distractions. Here one-pointed concentration is the path-finder for deeper meditative consciousness. Franco Columbo (Body-Building: Mr. World, Mr. Universe and twice Mr. Olympia) Question: How important are yoga stretching exercises to the mind? Sri Chinmoy: If one is practising stretching exercises thinking that he will be able to achieve peace of mind, then he is totally mistaken. No matter how many stretching exercises one takes, no matter how many hours one spends stretching, one cannot get peace of mind. Peace of mind comes only from one&#039;s prayer-life and meditation-life. I have a few students who are extremely good at stretching exercises. But unfortunately, their minds can easily defeat a monkey in restlessness. So if a bodybuilder or weightlifter wants to have peace of mind, then he has to be a God-lover consciously and devotedly. Dick Beardsley (USA, Winner of London Marathon 1981 with 2:11, 2nd place in Boston 1982 with 2:08:53) Question: I ran a 2:08:53 marathon with primarily a road-racing background. Would it improve my chances of making the 1984 Olympic marathon team if I partake in training and racing the 10,000 meters on the track? Sri Chinmoy: Definitely you will improve your marathon time if you run 10,000 meters on the track. Running is a physical subject, a mental subject, a philosophical subject and a subject of the Beyond. In the physical aspect, nobody will be able to tell you more than you already know. In the mental aspect, if you become used to running shorter distances, it can really help you. When you are running a marathon, mentally try to feel that you are running only thirteen miles rather than twenty-six miles. If you can convince the mind of this, and if the mind can convince the body that it is running only thirteen miles, then it will be a great advantage for you. This is not mental hallucination. A new discovery has dawned in the mind and the mind is passing it along to the body. Both the mind and the body will have to act together in order to reach the ultimate goal. In the philosophical aspect, you have to feel that your problems are as insignificant as ants and pay no attention to them. You have had problems with cows, dogs, puddles and road hazards of all kinds. You should take these problems philosophically. Although these things are extremely unfortunate and discouraging for a great runner like you, you have to feel that they are almost part and parcel of a runner&#039;s life. If you can see them in this way, then when discouragement and temporary lack of enthusiasm attack you, at that time you can also overcome these obstacles. Finally, if you can think that through your running you are doing something that has a direct connection with the ever-transcending Beyond, which is far beyond the domain of the earth-bound physical mind, then you will get tremendous inspiration. This inspiration embodies added strength, added joy and an added sense of satisfaction. Mary Slaney-Decker (Athletics: world-record holder and twice gold medallist in the 1983 world championships) Question: How fair is it to know that other female athletes, because of drugs, have a chemical advantage over their competitors, and how can a natural athlete such as myself justify the use of world rankings knowing that other athletes using chemicals are consistently ranked higher than so-called natural athletes? Sri Chinmoy: Sometimes it is good and necessary to know what others are doing. If one is a runner, this can encourage one&#039;s competitive spirit. Again, sometimes it is a great hindrance when we know what others are doing. It puzzles us and, at the same time, we have no inclination to adopt their methods. In cases like this it is always good to have confidence in our own natural abilities. Nature embodies the cosmic energy. This cosmic energy is infinitely stronger than any man-made chemicals. This energy comes from the ultimate Source and it leads us to the ultimate Source while fulfilling and satisfying us along the way. Chemicals and other artificial things will ultimately fail, for they are unnatural. Anything that is unnatural is like a balloon. For a while it will dazzle us and puzzle our human mind, but eventually it will burst. Greg Meyer (USA, Winner of the 1983 Boston marathon in 2:09; US record holder for 15km and 20km) Question: Why do I get more satisfaction from training than from running? Sri Chinmoy: You get more satisfaction from your training than from your racing because when you train, you have more oneness with your inner life, which embodies infinite satisfaction. When you race, you are competing with the others because you want to defeat them. The challenging spirit that comes in competition quite often suffers from anxiety, worry, doubt, hesitation and despair. When you are just practising, however, you are performing before the most intimate &quot;members&quot; of your family: body, vital, mind, heart, and soul. In fact, these intimate members of your own being are practising with you. It is totally a family entertainment. While practising, you are consciously working to transcend your capacities. At that time, you are listening to the message of the ever-transcending Beyond, and the message itself is complete satisfaction. But when you compete against others, you are more concerned with victory than self-transcendence. So naturally hesitation, anxiety and doubt have free access to your heart and mind and you do not and cannot have satisfaction. Rod Dixon (New York marathon winner, Olympic Games 1972 1500 m bronze, 1976 Olympics fourth place in 5000 m) Am I being unreasonable to expect my family to understand my physical urge to pursue my running life? I want to please my family, yet I also want to please my running career. Sri Chinmoy: You are a great runner. Already you have achieved astonishing glories in your running career. In order to achieve such sublime heights in the running world, you have made tremendous sacrifices, and the members of your family also have made tremendous sacrifices. This kind of mutual sacrifice is in no way an indication of your negligence toward your family. In the course of thinking of the Ultimate or meditating on the Ultimate, along the way you make apparent sacrifices. You have to know that ultimately these sacrifices themselves become a source of illuminating satisfaction. Or they pale into insignificance when you are repeatedly crowned with Himalayan success. With their human hearts, the members of your immediate family want to possess you and have you all the time around them. Your affection and love for them and their affection and love for you mean everything to them. Perhaps your running laurels are secondary to them. But again, these same members of your family each have a divine heart. Unlike the human heart, which wants to possess and be possessed, the divine heart wants only to give of itself, widen itself, receive the vast world and be received by the vast world. These are the messages that the divine heart receives from the higher worlds and offers to the outer world at large. Those who live in the divine heart are meant for the whole world. The messages that this heart gives them they do not keep secretly or sacredly inside their immediate family. No, they offer these messages to all humanity. So if any want to possess you or want to claim you as their own, very own, they should try to live in the divine heart, just as you are doing. If you and also the members of your immediate family can all live in the divine heart, then your commitment to your dear ones and their full understanding of what you were, what you are and what you are going to become will eventually and unmistakably bring boundless joy and boundless satisfaction to you and also to them. John Savage (American tournament tennis player) Question: Why is it so difficult to progress or excel in sports? Sri Chinmoy: In life, fortunately or unfortunately, nothing is easy. If things are easy, then we will be satisfied with our self-complacent life. Like a frog, we have to jump, jump, jump! If things are easy, if we always succeed, then we won&#039;t value our capacities or appreciate our achievements. At every moment we must value not only our successes and achievements but also the efforts we make. We must value at every moment not only what we become but what we are doing in the process of becoming. We cannot separate the effort from the result. Unfortunately, we do not appreciate our efforts. We admire and adore only the result. for years and years we practise hard. Then, in a short time, the tournament is over. Afterwards, the world only remembers that there was a champion at Wimbledon or the U.S. Open or in France. But for that, how many years of preparation did it take? Four, eight, ten, twelve years! This the world doesn&#039;t appreciate. It only appreciates the victory, not the preparation. Channel-Swim-Team &#039;86 (Swimmers of the SCMT who in 1986 attempted to swim across the Channel (33-42 km; 12-22 hours; water temperature 14-18 C) Question: This year about half the swimmers have swum the Channel. How can one prepare oneself better inwardly in order to be more successful next year even with bad weather conditions like cold water, high waves and unfavourable current conditions? Sri Chinmoy: As soon as you jump into the water, you have to imagine that behind you is fire. If fire does not frighten you, then think of any kind of animal that frightens you most - a lion or a tiger or an alligator or a jelly fish or anything. As soon as you enter into the water, feel that the animal is behind you, chasing you. So you have to go forward and not backward. At the same time, always feel that something most beautiful is beckoning you. Try to imagine a most beautiful garden or golden shore in front of you. That is another reason why you are going forward. While you are in the imagination world, you will definitely feel less tiredness because you are in the dream world. Only be careful that you are still swimming. Otherwise, you will enter into trance, and your trance will take you downstairs. Imagination is reality in its own world, and imagination has strength in it. I have written thousands of poems and thousands of songs all from imagination. When you swim, you should sincerely pray to the Supreme in you. In my weightlifting, before I attempt each lift, I pray and meditate for three or four minutes. I go to this side and that side to pray and meditate. So you also should pray and meditate before you swim, and not only on the day that you are going to swim the English Channel. For us, the physical is just a vehicle for our soul&#039;s expression. The body itself can do nothing. When I see that my wrist has held 2,000 pounds, it is unimaginable, unbelievable. But I did it. Even if you are healthy and in good form do not depend on yourself. Depend 100 per cent on divine Grace and feel that some higher force is pushing and pulling you forward." />

<p>Craig Virgin (American 10,000 m champion, twice World Cross-Country champion, 2:10 marathoner)</p>
<p>Question: How do I cope with the pressure of winning or, on the other hand, the disappointment of losing, in a sports competition?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: You can cope with the pressure of winning if, a few days before the race or even just before the start, you can imagine the pleasure of rejoicing in your victory. Imagination is not wishful thinking; it is not a baseless reality. Imagination is reality itself in another world. We bring it down to this world the way we bring down fruits from a tree.</p>
<p>To cope with the disappointment of losing, you have to ask yourself whether the mind is disappointed or the heart is disappointed. You will realise that it is your mind that is disappointed and not your heart. The mind creates division; the mind is division itself, and division is another name for pain, devastating pain. The heart, on the other hand, creates oneness; in fact, the heart is oneness itself, and oneness is another name for joy, spontaneous joy. When you live in your heart, even if your worst rival wins the race, you will not feel miserable. To your wide surprise, you will find that his joy quite unconsciously and unexpectedly will enter into you and widen your heart. Then you will feel almost the same joy that the winner feels.</p>
<p>Eammon Coghlan (Ireland, Olympic Finalist in 1500 m, 1976 and 1980 in each case 4th place; world-record holder for the indoor mile)</p>
<p>Question: Given an Olympic final, ten competitors are lined up in the race. All are 100% physically fit and prepared. What does it take for one runner to win over the others?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is not just a matter of luck as to who wins, for there are two ways to become a winner: one way is to concentrate on each runner and, like a magnet, draw into oneself the will power that each one has and almost empty them of their will power or life energy. This is called sheer determination-power. The determination-lion devours the weaker animals.</p>
<p>The other way is to identify oneself with the sources of the fastest speed and endurance. Here one consciously becomes one with the higher realities that are invisible, yet infinitely faster and stronger than the outer realities or the outer capacities.</p>
<p>If a runner is a conscious Truth-seeker and God-lover, then he will adopt the inner way and not the outer way. The outer way is the way of the lion: roaring and devouring the rivals.</p>
<p>Don Kardon (USA, President of the Association of Road Racing Athletes; 4th place in the 1976 Olympics marathon in Montreal)</p>
<p>Question: Why do you think runners are often able to achieve a kind of meditative state while running?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Concentration and meditation are members of the same family. When a runner focuses all his attention on a particular race, he is in a position to free his mind from uncomely distractions. Here one-pointed concentration is the path-finder for deeper meditative consciousness.</p>
<p>Franco Columbo (Body-Building: Mr. World, Mr. Universe and twice Mr. Olympia)</p>
<p>Question: How important are yoga stretching exercises to the mind?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If one is practising stretching exercises thinking that he will be able to achieve peace of mind, then he is totally mistaken. No matter how many stretching exercises one takes, no matter how many hours one spends stretching, one cannot get peace of mind. Peace of mind comes only from one's prayer-life and meditation-life. I have a few students who are extremely good at stretching exercises. But unfortunately, their minds can easily defeat a monkey in restlessness. So if a bodybuilder or weightlifter wants to have peace of mind, then he has to be a God-lover consciously and devotedly.</p>
<p>Dick Beardsley (USA, Winner of London Marathon 1981 with 2:11, 2nd place in Boston 1982 with 2:08:53)</p>
<p>Question: I ran a 2:08:53 marathon with primarily a road-racing background. Would it improve my chances of making the 1984 Olympic marathon team if I partake in training and racing the 10,000 meters on the track?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Definitely you will improve your marathon time if you run 10,000 meters on the track. Running is a physical subject, a mental subject, a philosophical subject and a subject of the Beyond. In the physical aspect, nobody will be able to tell you more than you already know.</p>
<p>In the mental aspect, if you become used to running shorter distances, it can really help you. When you are running a marathon, mentally try to feel that you are running only thirteen miles rather than twenty-six miles. If you can convince the mind of this, and if the mind can convince the body that it is running only thirteen miles, then it will be a great advantage for you. This is not mental hallucination. A new discovery has dawned in the mind and the mind is passing it along to the body. Both the mind and the body will have to act together in order to reach the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>In the philosophical aspect, you have to feel that your problems are as insignificant as ants and pay no attention to them. You have had problems with cows, dogs, puddles and road hazards of all kinds. You should take these problems philosophically. Although these things are extremely unfortunate and discouraging for a great runner like you, you have to feel that they are almost part and parcel of a runner's life. If you can see them in this way, then when discouragement and temporary lack of enthusiasm attack you, at that time you can also overcome these obstacles.</p>
<p>Finally, if you can think that through your running you are doing something that has a direct connection with the ever-transcending Beyond, which is far beyond the domain of the earth-bound physical mind, then you will get tremendous inspiration. This inspiration embodies added strength, added joy and an added sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Mary Slaney-Decker (Athletics: world-record holder and twice gold medallist in the 1983 world championships)</p>
<p>Question: How fair is it to know that other female athletes, because of drugs, have a chemical advantage over their competitors, and how can a natural athlete such as myself justify the use of world rankings knowing that other athletes using chemicals are consistently ranked higher than so-called natural athletes?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Sometimes it is good and necessary to know what others are doing. If one is a runner, this can encourage one's competitive spirit. Again, sometimes it is a great hindrance when we know what others are doing. It puzzles us and, at the same time, we have no inclination to adopt their methods. In cases like this it is always good to have confidence in our own natural abilities.</p>
<p>Nature embodies the cosmic energy. This cosmic energy is infinitely stronger than any man-made chemicals. This energy comes from the ultimate Source and it leads us to the ultimate Source while fulfilling and satisfying us along the way. Chemicals and other artificial things will ultimately fail, for they are unnatural. Anything that is unnatural is like a balloon. For a while it will dazzle us and puzzle our human mind, but eventually it will burst.</p>
<p>Greg Meyer (USA, Winner of the 1983 Boston marathon in 2:09; US record holder for 15km and 20km)</p>
<p>Question: Why do I get more satisfaction from training than from running?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: You get more satisfaction from your training than from your racing because when you train, you have more oneness with your inner life, which embodies infinite satisfaction. When you race, you are competing with the others because you want to defeat them. The challenging spirit that comes in competition quite often suffers from anxiety, worry, doubt, hesitation and despair. When you are just practising, however, you are performing before the most intimate "members" of your family: body, vital, mind, heart, and soul. In fact, these intimate members of your own being are practising with you. It is totally a family entertainment. While practising, you are consciously working to transcend your capacities. At that time, you are listening to the message of the ever-transcending Beyond, and the message itself is complete satisfaction. But when you compete against others, you are more concerned with victory than self-transcendence. So naturally hesitation, anxiety and doubt have free access to your heart and mind and you do not and cannot have satisfaction.</p>
<p>Rod Dixon (New York marathon winner, Olympic Games 1972 1500 m bronze, 1976 Olympics fourth place in 5000 m)</p>
<p>Am I being unreasonable to expect my family to understand my physical urge to pursue my running life? I want to please my family, yet I also want to please my running career.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: You are a great runner. Already you have achieved astonishing glories in your running career. In order to achieve such sublime heights in the running world, you have made tremendous sacrifices, and the members of your family also have made tremendous sacrifices. This kind of mutual sacrifice is in no way an indication of your negligence toward your family. In the course of thinking of the Ultimate or meditating on the Ultimate, along the way you make apparent sacrifices. You have to know that ultimately these sacrifices themselves become a source of illuminating satisfaction. Or they pale into insignificance when you are repeatedly crowned with Himalayan success.</p>
<p>With their human hearts, the members of your immediate family want to possess you and have you all the time around them. Your affection and love for them and their affection and love for you mean everything to them. Perhaps your running laurels are secondary to them.</p>
<p>But again, these same members of your family each have a divine heart. Unlike the human heart, which wants to possess and be possessed, the divine heart wants only to give of itself, widen itself, receive the vast world and be received by the vast world. These are the messages that the divine heart receives from the higher worlds and offers to the outer world at large.</p>
<p>Those who live in the divine heart are meant for the whole world. The messages that this heart gives them they do not keep secretly or sacredly inside their immediate family. No, they offer these messages to all humanity.</p>
<p>So if any want to possess you or want to claim you as their own, very own, they should try to live in the divine heart, just as you are doing. If you and also the members of your immediate family can all live in the divine heart, then your commitment to your dear ones and their full understanding of what you were, what you are and what you are going to become will eventually and unmistakably bring boundless joy and boundless satisfaction to you and also to them.</p>
<p>John Savage (American tournament tennis player)</p>
<p>Question: Why is it so difficult to progress or excel in sports?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: In life, fortunately or unfortunately, nothing is easy. If things are easy, then we will be satisfied with our self-complacent life. Like a frog, we have to jump, jump, jump! If things are easy, if we always succeed, then we won't value our capacities or appreciate our achievements. At every moment we must value not only our successes and achievements but also the efforts we make. We must value at every moment not only what we become but what we are doing in the process of becoming. We cannot separate the effort from the result.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not appreciate our efforts. We admire and adore only the result. for years and years we practise hard. Then, in a short time, the tournament is over. Afterwards, the world only remembers that there was a champion at Wimbledon or the U.S. Open or in France. But for that, how many years of preparation did it take? Four, eight, ten, twelve years! This the world doesn't appreciate. It only appreciates the victory, not the preparation.</p>
<p>Channel-Swim-Team '86 (Swimmers of the SCMT who in 1986 attempted to swim across the Channel (33-42 km; 12-22 hours; water temperature 14-18 C)</p>
<p>Question: This year about half the swimmers have swum the Channel. How can one prepare oneself better inwardly in order to be more successful next year even with bad weather conditions like cold water, high waves and unfavourable current conditions?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: As soon as you jump into the water, you have to imagine that behind you is fire. If fire does not frighten you, then think of any kind of animal that frightens you most - a lion or a tiger or an alligator or a jelly fish or anything. As soon as you enter into the water, feel that the animal is behind you, chasing you. So you have to go forward and not backward. At the same time, always feel that something most beautiful is beckoning you. Try to imagine a most beautiful garden or golden shore in front of you. That is another reason why you are going forward.</p>
<p>While you are in the imagination world, you will definitely feel less tiredness because you are in the dream world. Only be careful that you are still swimming. Otherwise, you will enter into trance, and your trance will take you downstairs.</p>
<p>Imagination is reality in its own world, and imagination has strength in it. I have written thousands of poems and thousands of songs all from imagination. When you swim, you should sincerely pray to the Supreme in you. In my weightlifting, before I attempt each lift, I pray and meditate for three or four minutes. I go to this side and that side to pray and meditate. So you also should pray and meditate before you swim, and not only on the day that you are going to swim the English Channel.</p>
<p>For us, the physical is just a vehicle for our soul's expression. The body itself can do nothing. When I see that my wrist has held 2,000 pounds, it is unimaginable, unbelievable. But I did it.</p>
<p>Even if you are healthy and in good form do not depend on yourself. Depend 100 per cent on divine Grace and feel that some higher force is pushing and pulling you forward.</p>

<div class="documentBody">
<p><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> gave the last concert in Torino on 30th May. We spent the night in the camp in the town and early in the morning we departed towards Cortina d’Ampezzo (via Venice and Belluno). Driving through highways all the way from Skopje we saw only plain fields and roads but when we started driving from Belluno towards Cortina the mountains started to show up and I started getting excited about the climbs getting so close. It was very satisfying finally driving through the scenic mountain roads and villages of Northern Italy and seeing the big walls of the mountains and towers rising out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/cort"/></p>
<p class="c3">- Cortina d'Ampezzo and the surrounding mountains</p>
<p>The period end of May / start of June is what is called “early” season in the Dolomites for climbing. The South sides of the mountains were clean of snow (as were all our chosen routes) but on the northern slopes there was still some snow to be found – especially in the steep and narrow gullies where we were supposed to pass on our way down. It was also off-season in the town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. When we arrived, the town was empty with only few people on the streets, many shops were closed due to “holidays” (for a month) and out of five camps only 2 were open. We settled down in the Cortina Camping and decided that next<br/>
day we would start our climbing.</p>
<p>31 May<br/>
Few routes had a start from the Falzarego Pass that is about 15km away from the town. This mountain pass is on 2117m height and we drove on the curved road from Cortina with a doubtful feeling about the weather since it was cloudy and grayish. As we arrived on the pass and looked towards Sass di Stria, the route we wanted to climb that day, we saw its top covered in clouds. Deciding to climb it anyway, we parked the car on the road towards Valparolla Pass where there is a small parking place “marked” with a big boulder on the left side. From here, there is a path that leads to the route that passes under the wall of the mountain and we came at the start in about 20 minutes. The start was marked with a driven in piton on the right side of the rib and putting the guidebook in my upper pocket of the backpack, after a moment of silence and concentration I headed up. The South Rib was first climbed by the Cobertaldo/Pezzoti party on 1 August 1939. It is an easy IV+ route (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>) that follows the right side of the rib with occasional turns on right (passing under harder, overhang-like problems) and one rightwards traverse on the last pitch over a big ledge that got us under the crux of the route – a IV+ crack that leads to the top. It was a good introduction route for the Dolomites. We used it to check out if the gradings in the guidebook are as same as or close to the gradings that we climb on our local crags and to feel the rock. In the first two pitches I felt the rock a little slippery but we got used to it very fast and what satisfied us as far as we have climbed on limestone this rock was very solid and firm. We liked it a lot. When we got on the top we had a very nice look towards the surrounding valleys and mountains and also we could see the Falzarego Torres that we wanted to do next.</p>

<p class="c3">-Sass di Stria and Vesna on top</p>
<p>1 June<br/>
This day we wanted to do 2 routes on the Two Torres di Falzarego that are c.2500m high. The route that we wanted to climb on Torre Piccola di Falzarego was on the South Arête, first climbed by Comici/del Torso/Varale party on 10 August 1934. It was graded IV+ and it had 7 pitches. The route on Torre Grande di Falzarego was on the West Face and was first climbed by S. Lussato on 13 August 1957. It was graded IV and it had 4 pitches. We wanted to do these routes in one day since when abseiling down from Torre Piccola we would come into the gap between the two towers and after short scramble in the gully we would be directly at the start of the other route. We parked the car about 1km before Falzarego Pass driving from Cortina at the parking of a restaurant and after a walk of about an hour we were at the start of the Piccola route. When I was ready to start I had a quick look at the watch that I had in the pocket of my backpack and it said 10:30. The route starts on a ledge about 10 meters to the right from the arête and after 2 pitches of IV/IV+ joins the arête. It was written that it starts under a painted number “10” – I could only see the painted number about 10 meters up from the ledge and it was only when I looked up the face standing at the foot of the chimney that is located at the far left side of this ledge that I saw it… Anyway, at the harder pitches there was enough in – situ protection and only the first 3 pitches were “the harder ones”. I would like to say that even when someone says that there is enough protection on some Dolomite route, you should always bring some slings and nuts because if you are not used to climb with in-situ protection on bigger distances you may find it “tricky”. After that it was easy climbing on grade III+ and we came to the top. There we saw few cemented belay bolts but the actual abseil station was located on a path few meters from the top when we looked down towards Torre Grande. From there we made a 25m abseil that brought us on a terrace from where we were supposed to go into the gap between the Torres… As we sorted out the gear in the backpacks, I looked at the watch and it said 15:30… 5 hours?!?! I could not believe my eyes. I told Vesna about this and we sat in silence for a while. We climbed the route without having almost any problem of route finding and it was all somehow much faster… We decided to go down.</p>

<p class="c3">- Falzarego Pass and the two Torres di Falzarego</p>
<p>When we came to the car there was one Italian climber (we climbed with him when he visited Macedonia) with a friend who said that he was surprised seeing us down instead of climbing another route since it was only 13:30. Now I could not believe my ears; I checked my watch and it said 16:30. After getting into the car I realized this watch had two timers (during the climb I probably unknowingly pressed the button for the timer to change…), and because I hardly ever used the two timers I completely forgot about them - and to make things worse, we could have easily climbed the other route also… Our friends climbed Sass di Stria that afternoon and Vesna and I went to find the start of a route that we wanted to do on Picolla Lagazuoi. We went that night for pizza and decided that we would have another try tomorrow  – with Vesna I would go on Torre Grande and our friends would repeat the route that we did today. We showed them the description, told them all they needed to know and the next day we split half way on the approach route and headed towards Torre Grande.  We saw where this route started the day before, so it was an easy start and easy climbing. The crux slabs were blackened with water, which made them slippery, but it was not a big problem since the route was short and this was only for about few meters. After an easy scramble of II/III at the last pitch we were on the top and we sat<br/>
relaxed for a while.</p>
<p>2 June<br/>
We cast our eyes towards Lagazuoi, since we wanted to do a route there and also towards Tofana di Rozes. We wanted to do 2 routes on this big mountain also but the conditions there were still bad. The exit route was still much under snow and a few friends who were hiking there the day before told us said a big avalanche came off passing very close to them. The south face during the days while we were there was always covered with clouds and we could not see as much as half of the wall. Coming down from Torre Grande was tricky. We put all our equipment in our backpacks since in the guidebook it was written that we have to “descent a short, chossy gully to a notch…from there less distinct path”… We thought this means an easy scramble down, but the gully was very exposed with walls going way down from each side and it was tricky climbing down through a very broken terrain. There were cemented rings, which we could use for abseil or mid-belay points coming down roped together but we didn’t want to take off the equipment from the backpacks so we moved very slowly and it was OK… On the way down we met with the two friends of ours – they came out mid way of the Piccola route since there were few parties climbing slowly in front of them. At Torre Piccola just when you will pass the first 3 pitches there is a ledge from where you can descend to a path that will get you on the approach route…So this was the third route that we did and for the next day we planned to do a route on Piccola Lagazuoi with which we would make a climb on all the mountains that are around Falzarego offered in the guidebook. We were having nice climbing but we were not very happy about the weather since every afternoon the sky would get covered with clouds and we couldn’t make a brave decision to climb something much longer the next day not knowing how the weather would go. Each morning when we would see that the sky had not so many clouds, we would go and climb this short routes but later in the day the weather would change (while climbing we could see how the clouds were coming over from the west) and it was raining almost every afternoon or night. But we decided to climb the 250m high wall of the Piccolo Lagazuoi anyway since it was not that big and the route was fairly easy, at least in the<br/>

<div class="documentBody">
<p><span class="c3">Demir Kapija is an area in South-Central Macedonia about 120 km f</span><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">rom</span> <span class="c4"><tt>Skopje. A journey down the Skopje-Solun (Greece) highway or a railway</tt> <tt>connection will take you to the small settlement of the same name. The</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river Vardar separates the settlement of Demir Kapija from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>the big limestone rockface that rises up right from the left bank of</tt> <tt>the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river (making it hard to approach for climbing). The rock itself is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fragile - like any other limestone but also because it has not been</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed very often – frequent climbing “cleans up” the rock by pushing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down the loose rocks or even blocks, but here in Demir Kapija you could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">till find some dangerous patches, not because of the technical</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ifficulty but because of the potential danger of falling rocks. On the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ther hand, there still remains many possibilities for new routes. The</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span><tt><span class="c3">xisting routes are about 200-250 metres long</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">(d</span><span class="c3">epending where they</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">s</span><tt><span class="c3">tart) and in the IV-VI grading area.</span></tt></p>

<p><span class="c4">-The approaches</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>There are two ways to approach the routes - one by climbing up over to</tt></span></p>
<tt><span class="c3">the top and following a marked path that leads down over at times</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>difficult ground, or the second way over the highway.</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">There are two tunnels on the highway (about 500m after the junction for</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the town) and after passing the first one there is a little stream on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the right that goes towards the river where you can find a fixed steel</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cord so that you can traverse towards the routes. Usually we take the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">second approach because it is much faster and safer, but when the river</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is too high, we go around taking the other way. Getting down is easy.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">From the top there is a trail that leads down to the highway and from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>there into the town, but because it is not very well marked we</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">followed</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the ridge which then met up with the trail - from there on it was easy.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<tt>With Vesna</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">we</span> <span class="c3">have climbed 4 routes in this area - Tulumba,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Polzav, Slavkova and Blazeva. Vesna also has climbed the route Vlatceva</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with another climber. Tulumba and Polzav are two of the longest</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">existing routes. They start close to each other and have a common exit</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">– they share the last pitch. The grades in these routes are up to V but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">they are concentrated mainly in the first two pitches and in the last</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">one. The last third of the first pitch of Tulumba has one overhang</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which I passed using one little rock that was stuck in the wide crack</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cutting the upper part of the overhang in half. Usually when you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climb on</span> <span class="c3">harder rocks these moves give you real joy because of their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">unusual quality, but not here - climbing in such a fragile environment</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made me feel a little queasy about having to use this kind of handhold.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>But this was the only way, so first I put a sling around the rock for</tt> <tt>protection and after that I grabbed the rock, pulled on it, and moved</tt> <tt>on as quickly as I could. The first pitch on Polzav also finds you</tt> <tt>under a small overhang. I had to combine</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the handholds for my left hand on the overhang with the slab on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right where there were no good footholds at all - I had to climb using</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friction moves and</span> <span class="c3">reaching with my left hand as far as I could over</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the overhang. In both cases it was a real relief when I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">out of it. There were good belay stances above and I secured Vesna –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">she came out of these</span> <span class="c3">“problems” with a smile on her face since she</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could enjoy climbing concentrated only on the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and not worrying about holding on loose pieces of rock. The middle two</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches are easy III scrambling. The routes (like all the others here)</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">do not</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>have enough protection “in situ”, so climbing here means having your</tt> <tt>cams, nuts, slings and pitons prepared. The hardest moves in the routes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">are “clean” – the rock here is not (very) fragile so we were free to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">concentrate only on the moves. It is where the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">are</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">not as high that the terrain and the rock gets more fragile – but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that’s also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">part of the climbing… Vlatceva starts also close to these routes but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">has a more straight line and ends up also more to the right. When you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">look at the rock from the other side of the river the line of the route</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(few meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the right of Tulumba) is visible, following wide and narrow cracks</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">up the rockface…</span></tt>
<p><span class="c4"><img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/tulslav" height="163" width="267"/><img class="c7" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/igor" height="178" width="290"/></span></p>
<p>-Pozav(left) and Tulumba (right)</p>
<p><br/>
<tt>Slavkova is a shorter route that starts somewhere on the half of the</tt> <tt>rock, but much harder and here the crux reaches up to VI+ grade. The</tt> <tt>line of the route is far from “diretissima” - it just starts and goes</tt> <tt>up fearlessly towards the hardest technical</tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulties that are in its way. After some easy scrambling from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">river bank we got under the route which starts following a dehidre and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ends up few meters under the overhangs.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">The first belay stance is actually at the tree on the top of this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">dehidre after which the route goes up the slab and traverse to the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right. After this there is a line that will get you right under the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first overhang. Here the climbers feel (and are) very exposed. The hand</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and foot holds are such a position that we had to move almost lying</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">bodies horizontally in the air, turned sideways on the rock and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stretching over as far as we could to the right. The overhanging area</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is so big that when climbers move through the first overhang they can</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see the ground 200 meters under their legs … The first overhang can be</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed following a crack that moves diagonally to the right towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the second overhang. We made the second belay stance under the second</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhang because there was a drag on the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and I just couldn’t move through something this difficult pulling up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with my hand or body. The correct line goes straight up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the second overhand, but if you want to climb it free without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">using the pitons</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“in situ” for aid climbing but you can’t because it’s just not your</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day, you can go around to the right. We didn’t do this - but I must say</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that I was not successful passing this overhang from the first try</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(even second, third…:) There is enough protection “in situ” through the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhangs and in the area over and under them, but not enough in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first pitch where we used the crack that we followed that is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cam-friendly.</span></tt></p>
<p><img class="c8" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/slavk1" height="175" width="274"/><img class="c9" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/previs" height="169" width="266"/></p>
<p>-Slavkova route and climbers under the second overhang<br/>
<br/>
<tt>Blazeva is easy long route where the crux of grade VI is in the last</tt> <tt>7-8 meters where the route gets a little overhangy. For a route of</tt> <tt>around</tt> <tt><span class="c3">250</span> <span class="c3">metres this means pleasant long climb with beautiful views over the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridges that this route follows. The start is over an easy and wide</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">chimney (IV+/V) with lot of possibilities for putting cams and slings.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">But the rock here is more fragile and I had to be very careful how I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was climbing and what I was holding to because everything that would</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">brake would fall directly down on Vesna through the chimney where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">her belay stance was. After the first pitch there are two or three easy</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of easy II/III scrambling. Here we moved parallel and when we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">got at the point where the route gets more vertical we made the belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stance. From here on it gets a little harder but the rock was very</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hospitable for belay means. The last (very short) pitch has a grade VI</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and it starts on a big terrace where we enjoyed the views on the both</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sides of the canyon. The name “Demir Kapija” actually means “Iron</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Gate”. The canyon is like a gate from one valley to another so being on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a top or close gives you unique opportunity to see how the river curves</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the valleys on the both sides. The last pitch can be also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed by another</span> <span class="c3">variation that goes a little towards to the left</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">where we found big handholds and big cracks for cams (I could see a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">old and rusty pitons on my right that were from the harder variation).</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">These were the only “in situ” protection that we saw in this route.</span></tt></p>
<p><tt><span class="c3"><img class="c10" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/blaz" height="142" width="282"/><span class="c4"><img class="c11" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/abz" height="209" width="287"/></span></span></tt></p>
<p><span class="c4">-The upper part of Blazeva</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>The Demir Kapija area is one of the hottest places in Macedonia (if</tt> <tt>not the hottest), so usually we don’t climb here during the summer</tt> <tt>period. The rock faces south so during the whole day</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">climbers are exposed under the sun and climbing on temperatures high</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">over 40 degrees Centigrade can be very exhausting… Still between the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tunnels, there is enough protection and shade and there are some short</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sport-climbing routes that can be done if it is really hot. There are</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>good places for putting up a tent near the small stream that also</tt> <tt>passes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">through</span> <span class="c3">here.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This was the place where, 7 years ago, I began climbing unprotected big</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">routes and I had to plan the route all by myself. I remember during</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first climb I was so concentrated</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on what I was doing while climbing that I only started noticing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">surroundings after reaching the upper half of the route. During</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first hour or two of climbing I couldn’t see anything else around</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only the gray rock, the forms on it, cracks, hand and footholds - I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">so concentrated climbing and protecting my climbing partner that it was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only after some time that I started seeing the valley. It was like</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being awakened from sleep - looking at the surrounding</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">environment, the river that was passing down there, the train, the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">town. It was like the picture was slowly getting filled piece by piece.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was amazed by this effortless concentration that climbing got me in…</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">In few books written by climbers I’ve read how they compare this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">activity with meditation. Meditation, like climbing, gives you a rare</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">opportunity to analyze</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">yourself and go deep and find your limitations and go over them. I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">remember a quote from one climber (unfortunately I can’t remember who</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that) who said that only when we will climb the mountains that are in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ourselves, the mountains of jealousy, fear, anxiety, only then we will</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">be on the highest mountain of the world…</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This is what <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> says about concentration and meditation:</tt></span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><tt>“…Concentration is the open secret of focusing all one’s attention on</tt> <tt>a particular object or person in order to enter into and have one’s</tt> <tt>identification with that object or person. The final stage of</tt> <tt>concentration is to discover and reveal the hidden ultimate Truth in</tt> <tt>the object of concentration. What concentration can do in our</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">day-to-day life is unimaginable. It most easily separates our heart’s</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Heaven from our mind’s hell so that we can live the constant delight</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and joy of Heaven and not in the perpetual worries, anxieties and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tortures of hell while we are on earth…”</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>“Meditation is man’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering. When</tt> <tt>men’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering meet together man becomes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">immortal in the inner world and God becomes fulfilled in the outer</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">world…It is only through meditation that we can get lasting peace,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">divine peace. If we can meditate soulfully in the morning and receive</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">peace for only one minute, that one minute of peace will permeate our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">whole day…We need meditation because we want to grow in Light and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fulfill ourselves in Light…”</span></tt></p>
