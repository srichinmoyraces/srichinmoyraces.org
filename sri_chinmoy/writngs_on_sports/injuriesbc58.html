<meta name="description" content="Question: I find that sometimes I go through a period of making very good progress in sport; and then after some time everything falls apart and my training goes downhill. Sri Chinmoy: It happens to everyone. Life is not always smooth sailing; it goes up and down. The main thing is to get satisfaction. In sport, when you touch a peak you are very happy. When you are unable to reach your peak, you should not feel that it is your fault. It is not that you have deliberately injured yourself. You have not said to your body, &quot;I fed you so many times; now I want to starve you.&quot; If you are deliberately enjoying your lack of speed or lack of enthusiasm, then you are to be blamed. But if circumstances have led you to this condition, please try to maintain your equanimity and peace of mind. Feel that you are going through a phase that may last for three or four weeks, but that eventually it will pass. Try to think of the summit which you reached two or three weeks earlier, and try to remember the joy that you felt. Then you will see that the joy you got from your previous achievements will carry you through, and very soon you will not only reach but transcend your previous height. You are not fooling yourself; you are only bringing happiness into your system, and this happiness is confidence. Again, confidence itself is happiness. Try to feel that your problem is just a small obstacle, a hurdle that you will soon overcome. Then you will be able to diminish the frustration that you now feel. Once you diminish your frustration, again in a week or so you will be able to regain your capacity. But if you maintain or increase your frustration, then the problem will linger. It may go on for two or three weeks. Question: Always when I become very interested in the physical and playing sports, I injure myself to the point where I have to stop completely. Why does this happen? Sri Chinmoy: What actually happens in your case is that when you enter into the physical world - playing tennis or other things - you do not give value to the physical as such. You remain in the mind. A portion of your existence you throw into the game and another portion you keep totally in the mind-world. It is like cutting yourself in half. You are keeping your body on the first floor, but your consciousness is always on the upper floor, in the mind. If you can direct more of your mental energy into the physical when you play, this will not happen. You want to play; you want to win. But actually the concentration of the mind, the real concentration, is not in the physical itself. You know that you are playing tennis, but the concentration that the body needs from the mind is not there. There is a gap. The body without concentration from the mind is helpless. So, when you play, do not think of your mental work. Your mind may not be aware that it is thinking of the wrong thing, but it is one thing not to be aware of doing the wrong thing and another thing to concentrate consciously on the right thing. Inside you and all around you there are many beings. Because there is a gap between the mind&#039;s concentration and the physical activity, these beings can attack the physical. They need not actually be wrong forces, but they may create unfortunate experiences in life. Question: How can running help me overcome my spiritual weaknesses and impurities? Sri Chinmoy: While you are running - especially when you are tired - you are much more conscious of your breathing. You are more aware of when you are inhaling and when you are exhaling. While running, when you inhale, you can consciously invoke divine energy to energize you. This divine energy energizes the willing reality in you and illumines the unlit reality in you so that you can become a perfect instrument of God. When you breathe in the divine energy, automatically it changes or transforms undivine forces into divine forces. Each time you breathe in, if you can repeat just one time God&#039;s Name, or &#039;Supreme&#039;, or whatever divine name or form comes to mind, then that spiritual thought will increase your purity. Either it turns into purity within you or it grants purity to you. Then, when you breathe out, feel that a new eagerness and a new promise are going out from you to the Universal Consciousness. This new promise is nothing short of your sincere willingness and eagerness to become a good and perfect instrument of the Supreme. Question: Should we run even when we are extremely tired? Sri Chinmoy: As a rule, when we are extremely tired it is not advisable to run, for it will not help us in any way. At that time, running will be nothing but fatigue and self-destruction, and it will leave in our mind a bitter taste. But sometimes, even when we are not extremely tired, we feel that we are. At that time we are not actually physically tired. We are only mentally tired or emotionally tired, but the mind convinces us that we are physically tired. Our human lethargy is so clever! It acts like a rogue, a perfect rogue, and we get tremendous joy by offering compassion to our body. We make all kinds of justifications for the body&#039;s lethargy and make ourselves feel that the body deserves rest. So we have to be sincere to ourselves. If we really feel extremely tired, then we should not run. But we have to make sure that it is not our lethargic mind, our lethargic vital or our lethargic physical consciousness that is making us feel that we are extremely tired. This kind of tricky cleverness we have to conquer. With our imagination-power we can challenge the tricky mind and win. We weaken ourselves by imagining that we are weak. Again, we can strengthen ourselves by imagining that we are strong. Our imagination often compels us to think we cannot do something or cannot say something. We often use imagination in a wrong direction. So instead of letting imagination take us backwards, we should use it to take us forward toward our goal. Question: How do you run through inner pain? Sri Chinmoy: Inner pain is a joke. Outer pain I believe in. Sometimes I can&#039;t place my foot on the ground without getting such pain! But inner pain, which comes from frustration, depression, jealousy and insecurity, is a joke. Inner pain should be discarded like a filthy rag! Outer pain you cannot so easily ignore, but inner pain must be discarded. If you have inner pain, if you are jealous of someone or are in an undivine consciousness, then the outer running will actually help you. When you are running and perspiring, when you are struggling, at that time the inner pain goes away to some extent. Otherwise, if because you are depressed you don&#039;t go out to run, then you are just a fool. If you feel depressed while you are running, you can sing loudly and deliberately try to sing wrong notes. Then laugh at yourself. Some of my friends used to do this. They were good singers, but deliberately they would sing wrong notes while they were walking, and it would make them laugh. In that way they got rid of depression. Question: If one is in generally good health, what would cause pain and aches in the body? Sri Chinmoy: It is one thing to have good health and another thing to deliberately maintain good health. Unless you are consciously keeping good health, at any moment you may be attacked by some forces. It is like having a large amount of money without knowing about it. If you are not conscious of it, you may easily lose it. If you are not conscious that you have a flower, you are likely to lose it. Anything that you have must have some place in your awareness. You may have good physical health, but perhaps in two months&#039; time you have not thought of your body once, let alone tried to increase the strength of your legs or arms or to get some extra capacity. Unless you touch something every day, it does not shine. Often I have told people to touch the furniture in their homes every day. As soon as you touch something, it gets new life. If you are aware of something, immediately it shines and gets a new luminosity. If you have good health, if you touch your health every day, it gets new life. By giving attention to something, you give new life to it. Question: When I run I sometimes get a slight knee pain. Should I stop running at that time? Sri Chinmoy: If you get just a slight pain in your knee, and if the pain is bearable, then you should continue running. At that time, feel that if you run a hundred metres more, the pain will go away. Then, after you have covered a hundred metres, feel that the pain will definitely stop if you run another hundred metres. If you do this five or six times, then most of the pain will go away. Even if some pain remains, the mind has already taken away your awareness from it. Your mind has forgotten about it. But if the pain is absolutely unbearable, what can you do? You simply have to surrender to it and stop running, at least for a while. Question: How can we spiritually heal injuries? Sri Chinmoy: It is a matter of inner capacity. One kind of capacity is to heal the injury by bringing down peace and light from above. Another kind of capacity is to ignore the pain altogether. During your meditation, if all of a sudden you have intense aspiration, then you can bring down more light from above to cure your injury. But you have to do this consciously during your meditation. If during the day you casually say, &quot;Oh, how I wish I didn&#039;t have any pain!&quot; that will be useless. But while you are meditating, if you suddenly remember your pain, that is the time to pray and bring down more light. Again, you can increase your capacity to tolerate pain. Now you have pain, let us say, but still you run; whereas if you had had the same kind of pain four years ago perhaps you would not have been able to run. Again, sometimes the pain is unbearable and it is absolutely impossible to run. Then what can you do? But if it is bearable, try to run according to your own capacity. At that time, don&#039;t think of how fast this person or that person is running. Just go according to your own capacity and remain cheerful. All the time think that you are running only against yourself. Again, if it is beyond your capacity to ignore the pain, in addition to praying and meditating, you can also go to the outer doctor. Light is also inside the doctor. Question: Sometimes I feel pain in my foot, and I start worrying that if I keep running, I might get a stress fracture. This happens even if the pain is not that bad and I know that probably nothing will happen. Sri Chinmoy: If it is unbearable, excruciating pain, then something serious might happen. But if there is just a tiny pain in your foot, this kind of fear is only false anxiety that is coming to your mind. If you are worried, you can take rest for a few days and see if the pain goes away. If it leaves in just a day or two, you will know that it was nothing serious. In this way you will become more confident that nothing will happen to your foot if you run. So if the pain is not that serious, you do not have to worry. Your foot is not going to give out. It is only that fear has entered into your mind, and the mind has created false anxiety in you, a false alarm. You should not cherish these fears. Morning running is purity&#039;s beauty. Evening running is simplicity&#039;s luminosity. Don&#039;t take a late start. You may lose the race altogether. Keep your love-devotion-surrender Always on the alert. Then you cannot have a late start. Run! You can easily challenge The pride of frightening distance." />

<div class="document">
<p>Question: I find that sometimes I go through a period of making very good progress in sport; and then after some time everything falls apart and my training goes downhill.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It happens to everyone. Life is not always smooth sailing; it goes up and down. The main thing is to get satisfaction. In sport, when you touch a peak you are very happy. When you are unable to reach your peak, you should not feel that it is your fault. It is not that you have deliberately injured yourself. You have not said to your body, "I fed you so many times; now I want to starve you." If you are deliberately enjoying your lack of speed or lack of enthusiasm, then you are to be blamed. But if circumstances have led you to this condition, please try to maintain your equanimity and peace of mind. Feel that you are going through a phase that may last for three or four weeks, but that eventually it will pass. Try to think of the summit which you reached two or three weeks earlier, and try to remember the joy that you felt. Then you will see that the joy you got from your previous achievements will carry you through, and very soon you will not only reach but transcend your previous height. You are not fooling yourself; you are only bringing happiness into your system, and this happiness is confidence. Again, confidence itself is happiness.</p>
<p>Try to feel that your problem is just a small obstacle, a hurdle that you will soon overcome. Then you will be able to diminish the frustration that you now feel. Once you diminish your frustration, again in a week or so you will be able to regain your capacity. But if you maintain or increase your frustration, then the problem will linger. It may go on for two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Question: Always when I become very interested in the physical and playing sports, I injure myself to the point where I have to stop completely. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: What actually happens in your case is that when you enter into the physical world - playing tennis or other things - you do not give value to the physical as such. You remain in the mind. A portion of your existence you throw into the game and another portion you keep totally in the mind-world. It is like cutting yourself in half. You are keeping your body on the first floor, but your consciousness is always on the upper floor, in the mind. If you can direct more of your mental energy into the physical when you play, this will not happen. You want to play; you want to win. But actually the concentration of the mind, the real concentration, is not in the physical itself. You know that you are playing tennis, but the concentration that the body needs from the mind is not there. There is a gap. The body without concentration from the mind is helpless. So, when you play, do not think of your mental work. Your mind may not be aware that it is thinking of the wrong thing, but it is one thing not to be aware of doing the wrong thing and another thing to concentrate consciously on the right thing. Inside you and all around you there are many beings. Because there is a gap between the mind's concentration and the physical activity, these beings can attack the physical. They need not actually be wrong forces, but they may create unfortunate experiences in life.</p>
<p>Question: How can running help me overcome my spiritual weaknesses and impurities?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: While you are running - especially when you are tired - you are much more conscious of your breathing. You are more aware of when you are inhaling and when you are exhaling. While running, when you inhale, you can consciously invoke divine energy to energize you. This divine energy energizes the willing reality in you and illumines the unlit reality in you so that you can become a perfect instrument of God. When you breathe in the divine energy, automatically it changes or transforms undivine forces into divine forces.</p>
<p>Each time you breathe in, if you can repeat just one time God's Name, or 'Supreme', or whatever divine name or form comes to mind, then that spiritual thought will increase your purity. Either it turns into purity within you or it grants purity to you. Then, when you breathe out, feel that a new eagerness and a new promise are going out from you to the Universal Consciousness. This new promise is nothing short of your sincere willingness and eagerness to become a good and perfect instrument of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Question: Should we run even when we are extremely tired?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: As a rule, when we are extremely tired it is not advisable to run, for it will not help us in any way. At that time, running will be nothing but fatigue and self-destruction, and it will leave in our mind a bitter taste. But sometimes, even when we are not extremely tired, we feel that we are. At that time we are not actually physically tired. We are only mentally tired or emotionally tired, but the mind convinces us that we are physically tired. Our human lethargy is so clever! It acts like a rogue, a perfect rogue, and we get tremendous joy by offering compassion to our body. We make all kinds of justifications for the body's lethargy and make ourselves feel that the body deserves rest.</p>
<p>So we have to be sincere to ourselves. If we really feel extremely tired, then we should not run. But we have to make sure that it is not our lethargic mind, our lethargic vital or our lethargic physical consciousness that is making us feel that we are extremely tired. This kind of tricky cleverness we have to conquer.</p>
<p>With our imagination-power we can challenge the tricky mind and win. We weaken ourselves by imagining that we are weak. Again, we can strengthen ourselves by imagining that we are strong. Our imagination often compels us to think we cannot do something or cannot say something. We often use imagination in a wrong direction. So instead of letting imagination take us backwards, we should use it to take us forward toward our goal.</p>
<p>Question: How do you run through inner pain?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Inner pain is a joke. Outer pain I believe in. Sometimes I can't place my foot on the ground without getting such pain! But inner pain, which comes from frustration, depression, jealousy and insecurity, is a joke. Inner pain should be discarded like a filthy rag! Outer pain you cannot so easily ignore, but inner pain must be discarded.</p>
<p>If you have inner pain, if you are jealous of someone or are in an undivine consciousness, then the outer running will actually help you. When you are running and perspiring, when you are struggling, at that time the inner pain goes away to some extent. Otherwise, if because you are depressed you don't go out to run, then you are just a fool. If you feel depressed while you are running, you can sing loudly and deliberately try to sing wrong notes. Then laugh at yourself. Some of my friends used to do this. They were good singers, but deliberately they would sing wrong notes while they were walking, and it would make them laugh. In that way they got rid of depression.</p>
<p>Question: If one is in generally good health, what would cause pain and aches in the body?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is one thing to have good health and another thing to deliberately maintain good health. Unless you are consciously keeping good health, at any moment you may be attacked by some forces. It is like having a large amount of money without knowing about it. If you are not conscious of it, you may easily lose it. If you are not conscious that you have a flower, you are likely to lose it. Anything that you have must have some place in your awareness. You may have good physical health, but perhaps in two months' time you have not thought of your body once, let alone tried to increase the strength of your legs or arms or to get some extra capacity.</p>
<p>Unless you touch something every day, it does not shine. Often I have told people to touch the furniture in their homes every day. As soon as you touch something, it gets new life. If you are aware of something, immediately it shines and gets a new luminosity. If you have good health, if you touch your health every day, it gets new life. By giving attention to something, you give new life to it.</p>
<p>Question: When I run I sometimes get a slight knee pain. Should I stop running at that time?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If you get just a slight pain in your knee, and if the pain is bearable, then you should continue running. At that time, feel that if you run a hundred metres more, the pain will go away. Then, after you have covered a hundred metres, feel that the pain will definitely stop if you run another hundred metres. If you do this five or six times, then most of the pain will go away. Even if some pain remains, the mind has already taken away your awareness from it. Your mind has forgotten about it. But if the pain is absolutely unbearable, what can you do? You simply have to surrender to it and stop running, at least for a while.</p>
<p>Question: How can we spiritually heal injuries?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is a matter of inner capacity. One kind of capacity is to heal the injury by bringing down peace and light from above. Another kind of capacity is to ignore the pain altogether. During your meditation, if all of a sudden you have intense aspiration, then you can bring down more light from above to cure your injury. But you have to do this consciously during your meditation. If during the day you casually say, "Oh, how I wish I didn't have any pain!" that will be useless. But while you are meditating, if you suddenly remember your pain, that is the time to pray and bring down more light.</p>
<p>Again, you can increase your capacity to tolerate pain. Now you have pain, let us say, but still you run; whereas if you had had the same kind of pain four years ago perhaps you would not have been able to run. Again, sometimes the pain is unbearable and it is absolutely impossible to run. Then what can you do? But if it is bearable, try to run according to your own capacity. At that time, don't think of how fast this person or that person is running. Just go according to your own capacity and remain cheerful. All the time think that you are running only against yourself. Again, if it is beyond your capacity to ignore the pain, in addition to praying and meditating, you can also go to the outer doctor. Light is also inside the doctor.</p>
<p>Question: Sometimes I feel pain in my foot, and I start worrying that if I keep running, I might get a stress fracture. This happens even if the pain is not that bad and I know that probably nothing will happen.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If it is unbearable, excruciating pain, then something serious might happen. But if there is just a tiny pain in your foot, this kind of fear is only false anxiety that is coming to your mind. If you are worried, you can take rest for a few days and see if the pain goes away. If it leaves in just a day or two, you will know that it was nothing serious. In this way you will become more confident that nothing will happen to your foot if you run.</p>
<p>So if the pain is not that serious, you do not have to worry. Your foot is not going to give out. It is only that fear has entered into your mind, and the mind has created false anxiety in you, a false alarm. You should not cherish these fears.</p>
<p>Morning running is purity's beauty. Evening running is simplicity's luminosity.</p>
<p>Don't take a late start. You may lose the race altogether. Keep your love-devotion-surrender Always on the alert. Then you cannot have a late start.</p>
<p>Run! You can easily challenge The pride of frightening distance.</p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Day 2 - Aletschgletscher...</p>
<div class="documentBody"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The second day we have another glacier to walk along and then to cross: the biggest (I wish to say “hugest”) glacier in</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Europe</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, the Aletschgletscher. This is the day I will come to know how much the difference between the eight of us who DO have crampons and the many others who DON’T is. These crampons will come in like God’s Grace and will enable us today to do things the others cannot attempt. We will wander freely and wildly about almost anywhere on the glacier, unbound to its stony parts, edges, or sides. We leave the conventional routes. Anyway, there isn’t really any such thing as route, as there are no signs, no footsteps, the glacier changes its face every year, every month, every day and every hour. The small holes left by the spikes of the leader’s crampons are just like the natural snow-holes shaped by a heavily falling wet snow. The ridges are all alike, once you climb onto the top of any of them, they just look like another and yet another frozen giant wave of a petrified ocean framed by snow-covered mountains.</span>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And what is between the ridges is the abysm. Deep cracks. Sometimes man can simply step over, not thinking of the consequences of a false step, sometimes man jumps over, and sometimes they are just far too wide: you better turn back, find another way through. It is a Mynotaurus’ job as it is really a labyrinth and except for the guide’s instinct, orientation skills and comprehensive sight, there is absolutely no other hint or clue on directions.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">When it comes to jumping, it is always of a moment of intensity. A moment of victory over something very ancient that still prevails in man. Everybody can jump a meter, or one and a half even, unless he is seriously blessed or handicapped. But how many can jump one and a half meter without the slightest concern if -very obviously- there is nothing (just a deep gap) between the two ends of that meter? We will belong to the group of those who don’t mind the dark void below and just jump. One more inveterate habit of the human psyche has been overcome. I am grateful to my crampons. Even if I don’t always manage to perfectly land on the top edge of the other side, they get a grip and stick me to the aimed shore, not allowing me to slip down into the crevasse. Oh yes, God’s special spiky Grace comes very handy at this moment. On top of that these jumps remind me of a Zen story that is absolutely applicable to our situation: 'with small steps one cannot cross over a crevasse', said once a master to a disciple when the latter one asked him about how to overcome attachment <i>gradually</i></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<div class="c4"/>
<div class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl1"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl2"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl3"/></span><br/></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At the edge of the glacier, towards the mid-section of it, at the place where the gap between the ice-blocks and the rocky body of a side-peak closes, although still far from the rocks, still balancing gingerly on the crusty back of an immense frozen labyrinth, we start seeing colours! Actually white and grey and only one more colour: blue. Light blue with all its nicest hues and shades. Sky blue, turquoise, cobalt blue, cyanide-like blue, peace-blue, sea-blue and what not? There are myriads of bluish hues each one appearing somewhere in the depths of a crevasse, a breach, a wide gap, a torn mouth of the glacier... Now the ice-sea reveals its nicest face, makes itself unprecedentedly attractive. But if one looks deep into these mystic blue depths, still it is depth, danger and death the one is ought to see.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">This is Maya, the wonderful illusion of beauty and sublime forms, irresistibly drawing man towards herself. I literally have to force myself to keep my eyes on the guide, on the rope, on the next jump between two crevasse-walls, above yet another marvel-blue gap offering the perspective of ten or thirty or more meters of void below my feet. Thank God I was told before how to behave, thank God, my Master had spoken to me about Maya. This time there is no fall, I manage to cross all crevasses, avoid all treacherous snow-bridges and breath-thin ice-layers covering a two centigrade cold running water-stream... I just follow the leader, my eyes alternately moving from his step to the rope and then to my step, I faithfully trudge after him, raise arm, push the ski-stock and the crampons to where he stepped a few seconds before, go alongside small ridges, across crest-like hunches, just follow him silently, and I too am followed silently. The glacier doesn’t manage to devour any of us. One more hour and we reach the point where we cross from ice to rock first climbing down the gap and then up the wall. My crampons have an amazingly good grip on a totally smooth rock face.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Soon we find ourselves amidst a debris of boulders and a road up to some saddle of a mountain. Crampons and rope off, we will just walk up. (Of course this walk doesn’t exactly mean walk, but it is still a safe upward road, with no additional security devices needed, cables being installed through the tougher sections.) Only a hundred meters of altitude difference and we have a more complete, somewhat distant and therefore comprehensive view of the central sections of the glacier and its bend. Breath-taking, exhilarating and challenging. We try to look back to where we have come from, but that is lost somewhere in space. We see however the last one or two kilometre long wandering section of the glacier, the labyrinth we have been in. Thousands of ridges separated by thousands of crevasses, abysses, blue holes to loose yourself in… I feel a sort of self-contempt especially when we shake hands with the group leader and he congratulates us for accomplishing the tough parts without accidents. We thank him on our turn. After all, it was his skills, experience, knowledge of the mountain, instinct of the glacier and above all, attention and patience that dragged us along and across two glaciers in two days. He coils the rope and says nothing. The blueness of a summit-background sky is lost in his eyes, he is thinking of the next trip already...<br/></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Finally, the hardest lesson comes: we are off the glacier, far from the crevasses, gone through the moraine, rock-climbed one of the walls neighbouring the giant body of the glacier, as we gain height on the slope where thousands of boulders of various size were cast by some titan architect, we see more and more of this 900 meters (2700 feet) thick block of ice and snow AND yet the end is beyond our reach... there remains still slope after slope, half-vertical boulder-fields petrified before a fatal fall, then steep rock and then ice-covered rock and then a fresh-snow-covered avalanche field and only far above all these are the ridges, crests and cols connecting summits and high-points of our earth’s noble back.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The journey doesn’t end until it takes toll even on our absolutely last drop of strength, concentration, patience, swiftness and breath. Had it not been for God’s Grace in form of the guide, the map, the crampons, the avalanches that did NOT launch themselves to rush on us, it would be a total failure I have to report. But God’s Grace is somehow there, at the right place, at the right moment. I am prone to believe that this is our last and only chance... Final lesson for today, you may have a rest now, before embarking again.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And I see poor me thereafter, pulling myself together before getting off a train and then again getting on two more trains in</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Switzerland</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. Quite a boring dream isn’t it? Imagine, I have seen this quite often in the recent past! Well, that’s the dark side of mountaineering: the distance you have to cover until you reach the mountain. Just like the multitude of lives we have to crawl through till the moment comes for us to see the point in all that.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">So, I see myself again, leaning against the window of a narrow-railway mountain train, feeding myself on the exhilarating, spectacular view of some yet unknown, unsuffered three-four thousand meter high summits... and a glorious rainbow there, no, not up in the sky, but rather down, below our trail, in a blooming early-July valley!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I see myself gasping for air later on at 1900 meters when a determined wave of wind finally comes to my appeal and lifts several layers of fog and mist, unveiling what is known to the present day as the ‘cimborasso’ of alpine climbing, the uttermost challenge in Europe’s mountaineering, the culminating combination of danger and difficulty: EigerMORDwand, the Killing Northern Wall of Eiger, the Monster that claimed so many valuable lives and that destroyed so many flourishing climbing careers and success stories. A place of pilgrimage for me, the poor beginner who would never even venture risking my life at the sheer foot of this disastrously whimsical mountain god! I inwardly bow to the giant and try to get as far as possible before another flock of Japanese or Indian tourists invades every little accessible panorama-viewing corner. No wonder, the place is too popular for it is terribly spectacular, reachable without any physical effort (quite unusual for a place of pilgrimage) AND because Japanese climbers successfully conquered this notorious North Wall in 1969, what more is, they actually opened a new, direct route to the top. Therefore, without exception, every Nipponese visitor will have a picture or video-shot of it, plus one more of his/her own self with the mountain in the background – if the Monster condescends to show its face... Were this at the Scala of Milano or at</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Paris</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">’</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Eiffel</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Tower</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, I wouldn’t care at all</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>J</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I am supposed to acclimatise a bit, to get higher and higher very gradually, but there are just toooooo many folks in here, attracted by the easy reach of the Top of Europe, the Jungfraujoch, the highest altitude railway station, post office and Bollywood style restaurant of our continent. So I rather put my gaiters, coat and hat on and rush into another small (and already packed!) train, rudely chasing away all conscience conflicts and emerging ideas about fair ways of reaching high on a mountain (ways that totally exclude vehicles!). I am doing exactly the same thing that these Tourists do –it hurts me, it is painful to the adolescent in me, who would rather die than spare an hour of ascension)!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Then I see myself mesmerised by the Eiger glacier yet a little higher at approx. 2800 meters altitude. It is neither an encouragement nor a hopeful perspective for me, concerned about the venture I am about to start...</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I see myself exiting a tunnel at 3400 meters, quite released that the crowd of tourist slowly ceases to follow the same direction. Oh yes, there is cold and snow outside! They prefer to watch it from behind the huge glass walls of an amazingly well-designed infrastructure in the mainstream of the Swiss Alps.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And then I see myself no more! I actually see a big white blank-out, some patches of golden-white sky gently leaning against an immensity of half-vertical white field... Without my sunglasses in two hours I would go blind! Everything is white and you can literally bite into cosmic radiation and diffuse sunlight...</span></p>
<div class="c5"/>
<div class="c5"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/gle"/>             <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/krev"/>             <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/krev1"/></span><br/></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The last thermometer I saw at the meteorological station indicated minus 6 Celsius grades, but I actually feel like walking on an enormous hypocaust system, heated by reflected and direct light as well as plain, unobstructed radiation. I am bound to imagine myself now, as I cross an utterly unknown, mystic field hanging between a four thousand meter high ridge and a glacier with its upper curtain starting somewhat higher than 3500 m. I start walking into the unknown. It’s a walk into white light with a totally reduced physical visibility and cosmos-wide room for inner vision. Yes, the sphere of protons and helium nuclei penetrating this space from the wide and vast Universe. Unfortunately, I have to command halt to the inner vision that perceives now the Supreme being in diamond-shine shapes: all I must see now is but the next sign indicating that I am still heading in the right direction. God knows that I am here, anyway. He, well, for me, the weak but heavy-bodied brown-haired woman in her thirties and her water-proof jacket, he is “she” and this she knows that I am totally alone. Journeying into the unseen something that the marriage of a mountain saddle and a giant glacier can ever offer... “She” knows also that I am neither lonesome, nor unhappy. I am more than the contrary of these.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">She takes good care of me. An inner voice knocks in, gently speaks my mother tongue and commands me: don’t err, don’t improvise. Just go on, without a meter of pacing off-tray. All improvised short-cuts take you to an abyss. I don’t see, but I feel and I remember from seeing the map that at my right is the mountain, the western wall of Moench and at my left there is the slope and crevasses of the Jungfraufirn glacier (which is my goal for tomorrow). And in between there is my shadowless shape wandering on, taking deep breaths of a rarified air and bright-white glow. Without the imminent danger, it would be a feeling I could call “trance”. But this is a rather conscious state of mind. Be sober, be reasonable, don’t make any stupidity. I walk on, trudging in the mildly falling snow and the light of a thousand suns behind its veil.</span></p>
<div class="c7"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">Altitude sickness</span></span></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Unavoidably it comes. After four or five hours in the hut at approx. 3650 meters (11976 ft) it slowly downs on me that I actually have to throw up. Thank God, the hut-owner provided air-sickness bags everywhere. Let us not go more into details, I filled quite a few of them. In clear moments when I refill the eliminated waters of my body and wait for the next attack which doesn’t delay coming, I try to think of my Master and of what he said on altitude sickness. The remedy seems to be the joy of transcending the height-limits. If only my tightly constricted stomach would understand that I AM happy! With a totally emptied belly, no water (as nothing stays in me at this moment!) in my dried-out body and overworked head, what makes me then happy about the sheer fact that I can see nothing but snow and snow-white ridges all around, that I can imbibe this rarified air and densified radiation in minus 6 Celsius grades and in a mild 27 km/ hour wind? My dear unknown friend, who dare infiltrating into my diary, if you have not gotten the mountain virus, you will never understand this… Actually, I don’t understand it either.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">True, a lotus is a kind of flower that likes difficulty, if you think that it grows with tightly, tensely gripped petals in the dirtiest waters, resists this medium all the way through, before it finally pushes its head above and then it doesn’t want to stop until it grows higher than any other water plant... But having this kind of a soul, does it really mean I can only be happy in hardship?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Yet, seemingly and realistically: I am happy here now while throwing up and on the other hand I have a hard fight trying to put things to the right place. Am I meant to do this at all? With my lack of physical capacities and unsportsmanly body how far can I drag myself just for the sake of this yearning for vastness and intensity?</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">If this nausea is the end, if this is what I had fought for...(if this is what I had run uphill for, tortured myself with push-ups for, if this is what I had walked through endless snow-fields for, if this is what I had worked and prayed for)... oh, well, then I guess I better walk down nicely, go home and start playing table tennis instead. I look deep inside myself. To my satisfaction, this glimpse is not limited by the walls of a gym hall and a ping-pong ball flying here and there. No! What lives in my inner eyes is an age-long yearning for distance within sight, for spaces below my feet, for ridges that lead me while I am balancing above a two-sided void. What lives in my inner heart is longing for vastness, for the picture of dozens of blue parallel ridgelines and the wind eternally lifting and dropping clouds. What abides in my inner mind is an unbreakable aspiration always to get higher and higher until one’s vision can encompass the rest of the world in its totality, from above.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">All ailment will have to go away, I am not meant to collapse here, emptied of all physical contents with a pale face! Slowly by slowly I get better. The headache wouldn’t stop for a minute, but at least the next gulp of water doesn’t trigger any volcanic reaction. I am being pulled together, I can think normal, climb down the stairways and up again. It is just the pain in brain that tortures me relentlessly. God, where are you?<br/></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/plan"/>            <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/plan1"/>            <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/se"/></span></p>
<div class="c5"/>
<p class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Then all of a sudden four Gods walk in. None of them less than six feet tall, the cream of British Lake District climbers makes an appearance here after having successfully climbed Moench, the brother</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">mountain</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">of</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Eiger</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. They were the four men in black – nearing the summit – I saw from the col of the mountain this afternoon! In seconds the deserted, empty entry hall becomes a warehouse of entangled ropes, ice axes, crampons, harnesses hanging from everywhere. A world I somehow feel more comfortable in.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I try to look less disgusting with all these full nausea bags around me, but they actually don’t seem to look down on me for that. Two of them happen to be doctors! And one of them happens to have the same kind of headache. In memory of this new British-Transsylvanian mountaineering friendship we share a couple of Aspirins. Later on a French climber lady tells us that this was the best thing we could have taken for altitude disease. She takes one a day each day she spends above a certain height and never has problems ever since she discovered this. Again I learned something. The time the remedy takes for healing me is quite long however. Basically the whole night! I use this time for praying for protection. Later on I will come to know that this was a very wise thing, I really needed what I asked for.<br/></span></p>
<p class="c10"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">DAY 1</span><br/></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Next morning is the morning of a slow trek down to the other valley and also of the quest of a Master. I hope you don’t mind the metaphor, I just mean that it took me some time to find the mountain guide I was allotted to. We look at each other. I know at first sight that he is an old mountain bear, familiar with every little crack and every big gully labyrinth of the glacier, absolutely at ease at handling any equipment and danger situation should it come to a rescue operation. And he probably knows of me immediately that I work in an office, have overweight problems and am not very confident when it is a matter of physical skills. He probably also feels how badly I want yet to do this trip. To have the taste of the unknown. When I put the harness in, with a strong pull he tests whether I adjusted the clips well, closed the screw karabiner properly etc. He is satisfied and that gives me some confidence. But at the end, when we clip ourselves onto the rope, he makes the knot himself to be sure that I am safe. Now I (and the other rope-mates) have become his responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The strongest of the team is a 27 year old Swiss boy; none would contest his good endurance and strength. He is at the end of the rope. The weakest is actually me, so I am just next after the leader, that is: second to the guide. We keep a distance from each other, so that the rope is tight (or almost) for in case of a fall, closeness would mean that more than one person is pulled down by the bodyweight of the falling companion. And we start this comfortable descent into the very body and heart of the glacier. Silence invades, envelopes everything and everyone. For hours and hours we only speak when someone gets into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">From the altitude of 3400 meters we will descend to 2600 and then climb up a laddered wall (an easy "via ferrata") back to 2800 to sleep there in a hut. But this is just the altitude difference. The distance we have to cover is, of course, much longer and it definitely is much less safer than merely walking five hours. Below our feet is a 900 meter deep ice cube, cut and ploughed a million times by the natural erosion, rich in cuts and abrasions and furrows and cracks and crevasses and holes and precipices and gullies and what not! And all these are covered with snow or are abridged by snow-plates to the point of being totally masked.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Sometimes one doesn’t walk on the glacier, but on a layer of thickened consistent snow with a hollow space under it! And sometimes these snow-bridges don’t resist man’s bodyweight. These are the moments when the soil (well, the snow carpet beneath) suddenly opens below your feet and in a second you find yourself hanging on a rope above a black emptiness of an unknown depth (anything from nine to almost nine hundred ! meters). In lucky cases one of your feet or at least your hands, arms still have something solid to hold onto, your upper body may be bent or leaning on snow with your lower body in the absolute nothing, but even then it is quite a manoeuvre to liberate yourself from the pull of dark depth and eventually of this porridge-like snow rim that may prevent your thigh from being lifted above the ground (quasi the other shore of the snow-crevasse).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">It is hard to imagine if you haven’t experienced it yet, and I admit, to me it was a scary feeling. I just wonder how I could be so rational when it first happened. At an unfortunate step I found myself doubled with my stomach and two arms hugging the snow where fifteen seconds ago the guide had stepped, while one of my feet lost all ground, I could only see some dark distance below it. My other leg was entangled in the wet snow wall of the crevasse. In seconds interfered some sober mind that wasn’t probably the real mind: 'don’t look down into the bottom, do it fast, but do it gingerly'. It still took me some time to cautiously overcome the situation without further ruining my snow bridge (the part of it that didn’t break and fall down). It is like trying to climb up a hopper or a funnel that is turned upside down, or like coming up from a bottle through its tightening neck. And on top of this, this neck is so fragile, so vulnerable. A wrong movement would send my only (seemingly solid) support down into the hole and then I would loose all ground, all fixed spot, testing what it feels like to be a spider with only the rope holding my weight. So, without ruining the place where one has to step next, one gently forces oneself to the surface, sometimes even the people closest in the rope can give him a pull and one is up again. Until the next fall</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>J</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At the second bad luck event, I was grateful to the rope, to the guide who held it and I fully agreed with my much more experienced climber friend D, who had told me well beforehand 'a glacier is always life-threatening if you cross it on your own'. The parallel is also very clear: without a master one should definitely not venture into the advanced mountaineering fields of spiritual life, unless one is tempting suicide. Without strong people around you in the same rope, falling into a crevasse like this can very easily turn into a fatal experience right from the beginning. And this is yet nothing compared to the higher glaciers of our earth, the ice-falls of the Himalayas where you don’t simply walk ON TOP of these fragile ice and snow bridges and features, but also, you are bound to risk going INTO and BELOW and BETWEEN them, sometimes on all fours, sometimes in vertical, sometimes balancing through precariously placed metal ladders spanning over giant gaps etc. But let mstay with my limited experience and capacities for the moment.<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c7"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">‘Never ever do that’</span></span></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">After a couple of hours of cautiously trudging in the snow and still before I had the first experience of loosing the ground beneath my feet we stopped for a few minutes. We got a little closer together to have a chocolate, an apple, whatever. At this point I decide to go near the only other girl in our group of eight adventurers. Since I don't want to entangle the rope I just unclip myself, put the rope down and walk towards her. In seconds I hear the reproaching voice of the guide: 'What are you doing? Where do you think you are?'</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Uh, he is right, too right. I am on a glacier. I am above hollow spaces that - at places- only some fragile snow plates separate from me. And right now I am not even secured!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The two and half meters back to my knot in the rope have become a much longer distance. I make my way back sweating while the others look on, but - should I fall below- cannot help. A great lesson: never unclip yourself of the rope. You cannot leave just like that, or you expose yourself to danger.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">During the next hour I come to appreciate this rope (and the boundedness it means) three times, for I experience three (thank God, minor) falls.</span></p>
<span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">This night I know that I will have nightmares. If not nightmares than just vague movie clips right before falling asleep and all of them will end up with some black deep hole suddenly opening below my weight. No, I don't want that, anything but to revive these real pictures again. At this point my joy knows no bounds when I find my mp3-player in one of the pockets of the rucksack. How much I hesitated whether I should carry this little extra weight or leave it at home. Finally I squeezed it in the pocket "just in case". Nothing better can happen to me now. My Master's voice always helped me until now, whenever I was in a bad mood, low consciousness, prone to fear or tantrums. It does help this time also. Before the battery goes down due to the cold, I can listen to two poems at least. And my anxiety is gone along with those creepy pictures and scary feeling. His voice chases away my fear and my unpleasant memories of the day. I plunge in a healthy slumber for at least three hours. Then comes the predecessor of sunrise, the first dark purple ray of light cutting the Zulu night away from the snow-covered ridge above the hut. And it is no longer snowing. We might have a great day today.</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Four forty</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. The first climbers put their equipment on and set off. I stare at them, inwardly wish them safe tryouts and yearn to be like them one day: brave, daring, easy-hearted while pacing off in the dark daybreak.</span>
