<meta name="description" content="Question: I find that sometimes I go through a period of making very good progress in sport; and then after some time everything falls apart and my training goes downhill. Sri Chinmoy: It happens to everyone. Life is not always smooth sailing; it goes up and down. The main thing is to get satisfaction. In sport, when you touch a peak you are very happy. When you are unable to reach your peak, you should not feel that it is your fault. It is not that you have deliberately injured yourself. You have not said to your body, &quot;I fed you so many times; now I want to starve you.&quot; If you are deliberately enjoying your lack of speed or lack of enthusiasm, then you are to be blamed. But if circumstances have led you to this condition, please try to maintain your equanimity and peace of mind. Feel that you are going through a phase that may last for three or four weeks, but that eventually it will pass. Try to think of the summit which you reached two or three weeks earlier, and try to remember the joy that you felt. Then you will see that the joy you got from your previous achievements will carry you through, and very soon you will not only reach but transcend your previous height. You are not fooling yourself; you are only bringing happiness into your system, and this happiness is confidence. Again, confidence itself is happiness. Try to feel that your problem is just a small obstacle, a hurdle that you will soon overcome. Then you will be able to diminish the frustration that you now feel. Once you diminish your frustration, again in a week or so you will be able to regain your capacity. But if you maintain or increase your frustration, then the problem will linger. It may go on for two or three weeks. Question: Always when I become very interested in the physical and playing sports, I injure myself to the point where I have to stop completely. Why does this happen? Sri Chinmoy: What actually happens in your case is that when you enter into the physical world - playing tennis or other things - you do not give value to the physical as such. You remain in the mind. A portion of your existence you throw into the game and another portion you keep totally in the mind-world. It is like cutting yourself in half. You are keeping your body on the first floor, but your consciousness is always on the upper floor, in the mind. If you can direct more of your mental energy into the physical when you play, this will not happen. You want to play; you want to win. But actually the concentration of the mind, the real concentration, is not in the physical itself. You know that you are playing tennis, but the concentration that the body needs from the mind is not there. There is a gap. The body without concentration from the mind is helpless. So, when you play, do not think of your mental work. Your mind may not be aware that it is thinking of the wrong thing, but it is one thing not to be aware of doing the wrong thing and another thing to concentrate consciously on the right thing. Inside you and all around you there are many beings. Because there is a gap between the mind&#039;s concentration and the physical activity, these beings can attack the physical. They need not actually be wrong forces, but they may create unfortunate experiences in life. Question: How can running help me overcome my spiritual weaknesses and impurities? Sri Chinmoy: While you are running - especially when you are tired - you are much more conscious of your breathing. You are more aware of when you are inhaling and when you are exhaling. While running, when you inhale, you can consciously invoke divine energy to energize you. This divine energy energizes the willing reality in you and illumines the unlit reality in you so that you can become a perfect instrument of God. When you breathe in the divine energy, automatically it changes or transforms undivine forces into divine forces. Each time you breathe in, if you can repeat just one time God&#039;s Name, or &#039;Supreme&#039;, or whatever divine name or form comes to mind, then that spiritual thought will increase your purity. Either it turns into purity within you or it grants purity to you. Then, when you breathe out, feel that a new eagerness and a new promise are going out from you to the Universal Consciousness. This new promise is nothing short of your sincere willingness and eagerness to become a good and perfect instrument of the Supreme. Question: Should we run even when we are extremely tired? Sri Chinmoy: As a rule, when we are extremely tired it is not advisable to run, for it will not help us in any way. At that time, running will be nothing but fatigue and self-destruction, and it will leave in our mind a bitter taste. But sometimes, even when we are not extremely tired, we feel that we are. At that time we are not actually physically tired. We are only mentally tired or emotionally tired, but the mind convinces us that we are physically tired. Our human lethargy is so clever! It acts like a rogue, a perfect rogue, and we get tremendous joy by offering compassion to our body. We make all kinds of justifications for the body&#039;s lethargy and make ourselves feel that the body deserves rest. So we have to be sincere to ourselves. If we really feel extremely tired, then we should not run. But we have to make sure that it is not our lethargic mind, our lethargic vital or our lethargic physical consciousness that is making us feel that we are extremely tired. This kind of tricky cleverness we have to conquer. With our imagination-power we can challenge the tricky mind and win. We weaken ourselves by imagining that we are weak. Again, we can strengthen ourselves by imagining that we are strong. Our imagination often compels us to think we cannot do something or cannot say something. We often use imagination in a wrong direction. So instead of letting imagination take us backwards, we should use it to take us forward toward our goal. Question: How do you run through inner pain? Sri Chinmoy: Inner pain is a joke. Outer pain I believe in. Sometimes I can&#039;t place my foot on the ground without getting such pain! But inner pain, which comes from frustration, depression, jealousy and insecurity, is a joke. Inner pain should be discarded like a filthy rag! Outer pain you cannot so easily ignore, but inner pain must be discarded. If you have inner pain, if you are jealous of someone or are in an undivine consciousness, then the outer running will actually help you. When you are running and perspiring, when you are struggling, at that time the inner pain goes away to some extent. Otherwise, if because you are depressed you don&#039;t go out to run, then you are just a fool. If you feel depressed while you are running, you can sing loudly and deliberately try to sing wrong notes. Then laugh at yourself. Some of my friends used to do this. They were good singers, but deliberately they would sing wrong notes while they were walking, and it would make them laugh. In that way they got rid of depression. Question: If one is in generally good health, what would cause pain and aches in the body? Sri Chinmoy: It is one thing to have good health and another thing to deliberately maintain good health. Unless you are consciously keeping good health, at any moment you may be attacked by some forces. It is like having a large amount of money without knowing about it. If you are not conscious of it, you may easily lose it. If you are not conscious that you have a flower, you are likely to lose it. Anything that you have must have some place in your awareness. You may have good physical health, but perhaps in two months&#039; time you have not thought of your body once, let alone tried to increase the strength of your legs or arms or to get some extra capacity. Unless you touch something every day, it does not shine. Often I have told people to touch the furniture in their homes every day. As soon as you touch something, it gets new life. If you are aware of something, immediately it shines and gets a new luminosity. If you have good health, if you touch your health every day, it gets new life. By giving attention to something, you give new life to it. Question: When I run I sometimes get a slight knee pain. Should I stop running at that time? Sri Chinmoy: If you get just a slight pain in your knee, and if the pain is bearable, then you should continue running. At that time, feel that if you run a hundred metres more, the pain will go away. Then, after you have covered a hundred metres, feel that the pain will definitely stop if you run another hundred metres. If you do this five or six times, then most of the pain will go away. Even if some pain remains, the mind has already taken away your awareness from it. Your mind has forgotten about it. But if the pain is absolutely unbearable, what can you do? You simply have to surrender to it and stop running, at least for a while. Question: How can we spiritually heal injuries? Sri Chinmoy: It is a matter of inner capacity. One kind of capacity is to heal the injury by bringing down peace and light from above. Another kind of capacity is to ignore the pain altogether. During your meditation, if all of a sudden you have intense aspiration, then you can bring down more light from above to cure your injury. But you have to do this consciously during your meditation. If during the day you casually say, &quot;Oh, how I wish I didn&#039;t have any pain!&quot; that will be useless. But while you are meditating, if you suddenly remember your pain, that is the time to pray and bring down more light. Again, you can increase your capacity to tolerate pain. Now you have pain, let us say, but still you run; whereas if you had had the same kind of pain four years ago perhaps you would not have been able to run. Again, sometimes the pain is unbearable and it is absolutely impossible to run. Then what can you do? But if it is bearable, try to run according to your own capacity. At that time, don&#039;t think of how fast this person or that person is running. Just go according to your own capacity and remain cheerful. All the time think that you are running only against yourself. Again, if it is beyond your capacity to ignore the pain, in addition to praying and meditating, you can also go to the outer doctor. Light is also inside the doctor. Question: Sometimes I feel pain in my foot, and I start worrying that if I keep running, I might get a stress fracture. This happens even if the pain is not that bad and I know that probably nothing will happen. Sri Chinmoy: If it is unbearable, excruciating pain, then something serious might happen. But if there is just a tiny pain in your foot, this kind of fear is only false anxiety that is coming to your mind. If you are worried, you can take rest for a few days and see if the pain goes away. If it leaves in just a day or two, you will know that it was nothing serious. In this way you will become more confident that nothing will happen to your foot if you run. So if the pain is not that serious, you do not have to worry. Your foot is not going to give out. It is only that fear has entered into your mind, and the mind has created false anxiety in you, a false alarm. You should not cherish these fears. Morning running is purity&#039;s beauty. Evening running is simplicity&#039;s luminosity. Don&#039;t take a late start. You may lose the race altogether. Keep your love-devotion-surrender Always on the alert. Then you cannot have a late start. Run! You can easily challenge The pride of frightening distance." />

<p>Question: I find that sometimes I go through a period of making very good progress in sport; and then after some time everything falls apart and my training goes downhill.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It happens to everyone. Life is not always smooth sailing; it goes up and down. The main thing is to get satisfaction. In sport, when you touch a peak you are very happy. When you are unable to reach your peak, you should not feel that it is your fault. It is not that you have deliberately injured yourself. You have not said to your body, "I fed you so many times; now I want to starve you." If you are deliberately enjoying your lack of speed or lack of enthusiasm, then you are to be blamed. But if circumstances have led you to this condition, please try to maintain your equanimity and peace of mind. Feel that you are going through a phase that may last for three or four weeks, but that eventually it will pass. Try to think of the summit which you reached two or three weeks earlier, and try to remember the joy that you felt. Then you will see that the joy you got from your previous achievements will carry you through, and very soon you will not only reach but transcend your previous height. You are not fooling yourself; you are only bringing happiness into your system, and this happiness is confidence. Again, confidence itself is happiness.</p>
<p>Try to feel that your problem is just a small obstacle, a hurdle that you will soon overcome. Then you will be able to diminish the frustration that you now feel. Once you diminish your frustration, again in a week or so you will be able to regain your capacity. But if you maintain or increase your frustration, then the problem will linger. It may go on for two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Question: Always when I become very interested in the physical and playing sports, I injure myself to the point where I have to stop completely. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: What actually happens in your case is that when you enter into the physical world - playing tennis or other things - you do not give value to the physical as such. You remain in the mind. A portion of your existence you throw into the game and another portion you keep totally in the mind-world. It is like cutting yourself in half. You are keeping your body on the first floor, but your consciousness is always on the upper floor, in the mind. If you can direct more of your mental energy into the physical when you play, this will not happen. You want to play; you want to win. But actually the concentration of the mind, the real concentration, is not in the physical itself. You know that you are playing tennis, but the concentration that the body needs from the mind is not there. There is a gap. The body without concentration from the mind is helpless. So, when you play, do not think of your mental work. Your mind may not be aware that it is thinking of the wrong thing, but it is one thing not to be aware of doing the wrong thing and another thing to concentrate consciously on the right thing. Inside you and all around you there are many beings. Because there is a gap between the mind's concentration and the physical activity, these beings can attack the physical. They need not actually be wrong forces, but they may create unfortunate experiences in life.</p>
<p>Question: How can running help me overcome my spiritual weaknesses and impurities?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: While you are running - especially when you are tired - you are much more conscious of your breathing. You are more aware of when you are inhaling and when you are exhaling. While running, when you inhale, you can consciously invoke divine energy to energize you. This divine energy energizes the willing reality in you and illumines the unlit reality in you so that you can become a perfect instrument of God. When you breathe in the divine energy, automatically it changes or transforms undivine forces into divine forces.</p>
<p>Each time you breathe in, if you can repeat just one time God's Name, or 'Supreme', or whatever divine name or form comes to mind, then that spiritual thought will increase your purity. Either it turns into purity within you or it grants purity to you. Then, when you breathe out, feel that a new eagerness and a new promise are going out from you to the Universal Consciousness. This new promise is nothing short of your sincere willingness and eagerness to become a good and perfect instrument of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Question: Should we run even when we are extremely tired?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: As a rule, when we are extremely tired it is not advisable to run, for it will not help us in any way. At that time, running will be nothing but fatigue and self-destruction, and it will leave in our mind a bitter taste. But sometimes, even when we are not extremely tired, we feel that we are. At that time we are not actually physically tired. We are only mentally tired or emotionally tired, but the mind convinces us that we are physically tired. Our human lethargy is so clever! It acts like a rogue, a perfect rogue, and we get tremendous joy by offering compassion to our body. We make all kinds of justifications for the body's lethargy and make ourselves feel that the body deserves rest.</p>
<p>So we have to be sincere to ourselves. If we really feel extremely tired, then we should not run. But we have to make sure that it is not our lethargic mind, our lethargic vital or our lethargic physical consciousness that is making us feel that we are extremely tired. This kind of tricky cleverness we have to conquer.</p>
<p>With our imagination-power we can challenge the tricky mind and win. We weaken ourselves by imagining that we are weak. Again, we can strengthen ourselves by imagining that we are strong. Our imagination often compels us to think we cannot do something or cannot say something. We often use imagination in a wrong direction. So instead of letting imagination take us backwards, we should use it to take us forward toward our goal.</p>
<p>Question: How do you run through inner pain?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Inner pain is a joke. Outer pain I believe in. Sometimes I can't place my foot on the ground without getting such pain! But inner pain, which comes from frustration, depression, jealousy and insecurity, is a joke. Inner pain should be discarded like a filthy rag! Outer pain you cannot so easily ignore, but inner pain must be discarded.</p>
<p>If you have inner pain, if you are jealous of someone or are in an undivine consciousness, then the outer running will actually help you. When you are running and perspiring, when you are struggling, at that time the inner pain goes away to some extent. Otherwise, if because you are depressed you don't go out to run, then you are just a fool. If you feel depressed while you are running, you can sing loudly and deliberately try to sing wrong notes. Then laugh at yourself. Some of my friends used to do this. They were good singers, but deliberately they would sing wrong notes while they were walking, and it would make them laugh. In that way they got rid of depression.</p>
<p>Question: If one is in generally good health, what would cause pain and aches in the body?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is one thing to have good health and another thing to deliberately maintain good health. Unless you are consciously keeping good health, at any moment you may be attacked by some forces. It is like having a large amount of money without knowing about it. If you are not conscious of it, you may easily lose it. If you are not conscious that you have a flower, you are likely to lose it. Anything that you have must have some place in your awareness. You may have good physical health, but perhaps in two months' time you have not thought of your body once, let alone tried to increase the strength of your legs or arms or to get some extra capacity.</p>
<p>Unless you touch something every day, it does not shine. Often I have told people to touch the furniture in their homes every day. As soon as you touch something, it gets new life. If you are aware of something, immediately it shines and gets a new luminosity. If you have good health, if you touch your health every day, it gets new life. By giving attention to something, you give new life to it.</p>
<p>Question: When I run I sometimes get a slight knee pain. Should I stop running at that time?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If you get just a slight pain in your knee, and if the pain is bearable, then you should continue running. At that time, feel that if you run a hundred metres more, the pain will go away. Then, after you have covered a hundred metres, feel that the pain will definitely stop if you run another hundred metres. If you do this five or six times, then most of the pain will go away. Even if some pain remains, the mind has already taken away your awareness from it. Your mind has forgotten about it. But if the pain is absolutely unbearable, what can you do? You simply have to surrender to it and stop running, at least for a while.</p>
<p>Question: How can we spiritually heal injuries?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is a matter of inner capacity. One kind of capacity is to heal the injury by bringing down peace and light from above. Another kind of capacity is to ignore the pain altogether. During your meditation, if all of a sudden you have intense aspiration, then you can bring down more light from above to cure your injury. But you have to do this consciously during your meditation. If during the day you casually say, "Oh, how I wish I didn't have any pain!" that will be useless. But while you are meditating, if you suddenly remember your pain, that is the time to pray and bring down more light.</p>
<p>Again, you can increase your capacity to tolerate pain. Now you have pain, let us say, but still you run; whereas if you had had the same kind of pain four years ago perhaps you would not have been able to run. Again, sometimes the pain is unbearable and it is absolutely impossible to run. Then what can you do? But if it is bearable, try to run according to your own capacity. At that time, don't think of how fast this person or that person is running. Just go according to your own capacity and remain cheerful. All the time think that you are running only against yourself. Again, if it is beyond your capacity to ignore the pain, in addition to praying and meditating, you can also go to the outer doctor. Light is also inside the doctor.</p>
<p>Question: Sometimes I feel pain in my foot, and I start worrying that if I keep running, I might get a stress fracture. This happens even if the pain is not that bad and I know that probably nothing will happen.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If it is unbearable, excruciating pain, then something serious might happen. But if there is just a tiny pain in your foot, this kind of fear is only false anxiety that is coming to your mind. If you are worried, you can take rest for a few days and see if the pain goes away. If it leaves in just a day or two, you will know that it was nothing serious. In this way you will become more confident that nothing will happen to your foot if you run.</p>
<p>So if the pain is not that serious, you do not have to worry. Your foot is not going to give out. It is only that fear has entered into your mind, and the mind has created false anxiety in you, a false alarm. You should not cherish these fears.</p>
<p>Morning running is purity's beauty. Evening running is simplicity's luminosity.</p>
<p>Don't take a late start. You may lose the race altogether. Keep your love-devotion-surrender Always on the alert. Then you cannot have a late start.</p>
<p>Run! You can easily challenge The pride of frightening distance.</p>

<p class="c9"><span class="c8">- In Chamonix</span><br/></p>
<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Not having much time however, we decided to go to the mountains the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">very next day. In the morning we sorted out our gear, calculating what</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route we would do and how much we should take in our backpacks without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overloading them, before heading towards the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Aiguille du Midi Teleferique Station. After a fascinating ride which</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">took in a view towards the north face of this needlelike mountain where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we could see all the fine details of it, we arrived at the tunnels on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the top with a big group of tourists that wanted to have a closer look</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">towards Mont Blanc…<br/>
<br/></span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Here in the tunnels, there is an exit that leads down towards Valee</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Blanche. This exit is marked with all those 'Danger' red and yellow</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fluorescent signs and fences that warn 'other' people not to go there</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">without a guide or proper equipment. As we were putting on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">crampons and preparing the ice-axes under the close scrutiny of the</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>tourists, I felt like this exit was like a door of a plane and we were</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">getting ready to jump out of it with our parachutes on – the light that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ent</span></tt><tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">rs into these dark tunnels from outside is very bright and it</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">really feels like going into the unknown from that point on… Anyway –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we put on our helmets and glasses and we stepped out. I felt much</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">better here…</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
There was a very distinct path going down into the valley; there were</tt> <tt>surprisingly few people on it. I thought</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">that this was probably because of the warning that was posted in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the information office of Chamonix saying that because of the bad</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">weather</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(too</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">warm) there were many new big crevasses opened up in the mountains</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made even the normal routes a little complicated to pass… This is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a popular place where many guides from all around Europe go with their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">clients and probably they decided that it was not safe for the time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">to take someone inexperienced. We came down and put our tent in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“big white” and there were about 10 more tents there scattered around…<br/>
<br/></span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>There was a really nice view here – we could see the summits of du</tt> <tt>Midi, du Tacul, Jorasses in the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">distance... But the sun was really warming up the place and all of a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sudden the silence was interpreted with the crash of a stonefall down</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">North Face Triangle of du Tacul. We turned our heads immediately when</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we heard the sound and we could see the big rocks falling down towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">foot of the face followed by a cloud of dust. Everyone who was at</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">their tents or climbing on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">South East Pillar of du Midi was watching this sight; after a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">seconds we all continued whatever we were doing, but it was a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">warning…</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/></span></p>

<div class="c10"><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>We turned our sights towards the SSW Cosmique Ridge on Aiguille du</tt> <tt>Midi</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">(3842m).

<p class="c9"><span class="c11">- Mont Blanc du Tacul, Mont Maudit and the Cosmiques Ridge of Aiguille du Midi</span><br/></p>
<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>That night we decided to go towards Mont Blanc (4848m) over du Tacul</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">and Mont Maudit (4465m). We didn’t have any acclimatization, but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we didn’t feel any problems at all going over du Tacul and climbing</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt>towards Mont Maudit. But we had a late start and the weather was</tt> <tt>getting warmer and warmer… We came to a point on Maudit where there</tt> <tt>was</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">a 70meters high almost vertical piece of climbing to get on the ridge</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of this mountain after which some easy hiking of 2-3 hours was left to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">gain Mont Blanc. On the way up we met few parties returning from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">top and when we came to this point, we waited for another 2 parties to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">rappel down since it was a narrow path leading to a safe belay stance</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on a piece of rock… Climbing towards it was really scary. By that time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was almost climbing in shorts and was over 4000m altitude in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Alps</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which at least for me was surprising… But when I started climbing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">real problem showed up. Under the very fragile vertical ice I could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hear water running down the vertical slope… The ice could break at any</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">moment, my intuition was telling me that we should go back and I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">shouted out to Vesna that I was climbing down so that she could belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">me properly. When I came back on safer ground we sat down, had</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">something to eat and drink and decided to have a try the next day.</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
The next day we actually decided to relax and go on the SSW</tt> <tt>“Cosmiques”</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Ridge of Aiguille du Midi. The route was first done by the Finch party</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on 29 August 1911. It is c260m long and it took us about 2 hours</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing. The overall grade is PD+ with a crux on the final rock</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of IV. Although it is recommended as an “introduction to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Alpine mixed climbing” (in the book “Mont Blanc Massif – Selected</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbs”) on the whole way up because of the very warm weather we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed on snow only for about ten meters on the traverse where the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">short rock wall starts before we got on the viewing platforms…</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">It was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">easy climbing with nice views towards Chamonix on one side and Valee</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Blanche on the other.</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
Arriving on the platform is done over a stair that ends right on the</tt> <tt>middle of the platform where most of the tourists are. Getting on the</tt> <tt>platform roped up together with our equipment hanging from our</tt> <tt>harnesses was really hard for us. To the tourists on the platform, it</tt> <tt>was like we had fallen from another planet, everyone was turning on</tt> <tt>their cameras to take a picture… We wanted to get out of there as soon</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">as possible and be back safe down in the valley. Just when we arrived</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">at</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the exit for the valley and thought we are safe a small group of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Japanese tourists surrounded us excited about the opportunity to have</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a picture with us… They were really happy exclaiming all the time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“...you are brave men…” When I was out in the snow away from all that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">noise I felt very happy about it.</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt><br/>
During the night we were awakened a few times with a roaring noise</tt> <tt>like the mountain was falling apart. It was thunder; I had a quick look</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">out of the tent towards the sky but the sky looked clear somehow… At</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">around 2 o’clock am we started getting ready again and this time we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could see only about 10 people ahead of us. The weather was the reason</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">for this since the skies now looked dark. After some time, just when</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">were crossing the last crevasse, a climber came alone and asked if he</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">can join our rope. He was a good Spanish fellow who had a problem of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">waking up his partner so he started out alone but felt unsafe at the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">crevasse barrier… We accepted him and continued. It was totally</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">different from 2 days previously. When we gained the highest point of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridge of du Tacul we were not able to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see anything from that point on.<br/></span></tt></p>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt><br/>
It was like gray curtain… Everyone was making a short 30minutes walk</tt> <tt>toward the summit of this mountain and going down. We did the same and</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">about that time the weather started to get much worse. It was snowing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">heavily and going down the steep track was tricky. We were roped all</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">together - Vesna going as first, I was in the middle and our Spanish</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friend (I have trouble remembering names) was last. Suddenly I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">heard a strange noise and out of the corner of my eye I saw</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">him sliding down the steep slope; I instantly screamed to Vesna to get</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down and drive her ice axe as fast as she could into the snow as I did</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">same; after two or three seconds there was a small jerk on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">rope but it stopped at that point. It all happened so quickly but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">luckily the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">slope was not so steep and the ice was not that frozen so the fall was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stopped without any bigger consequences. Needless to say, after this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">incident he was most grateful to us for accepting him in the party! The</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">weather was getting worse and worse and when we came down in the valley</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we felt a very strong wind that almost ripped off our tent… With great</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulty we packed the tent, packed everything in our backpacks and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">headed towards the telepherique. There were no tourists there now -</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only us and a few other climbers. As we arrived in Chamonix the weather</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was partly</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cloudy and it looked like there was a storm approaching from</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the surrounding mountains. We decided to stay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">here one more day and after that departed towards Alagna, Italy…</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>

            <p class="documentDescription">...Mission Gorge bouldering and climbing</p>
<div class="documentBody">A few years ago I visited the nice city of San Diego where the local Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team was organizing the annual <a href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/us/races/san_diego_swim__run/">Self-Transcendence Swim&amp;Run</a>. Those few weeks in the company of very hospitable Californians were a most memorable experience and something I will definitely never forget.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the beautiful beach and surroundings where the race was held, the thing I remember most was the incongruity between the amount of sport activities taking place and the hot weather. Fiding some shade in San Diego was a real adventure but it never stopped us running, playing soccer or ultimate frisbee and of course doing some climbing and bouldering. We did some climbing indoors in the Vertial Hold Climbing Gym - I had read that this was the largest climbing hall in Southern California and was anxious too see it... It is just a fraciton of the size of the hall I visited in Zurich, Switzerland but I had a lots of fun climbing there with my friend Atulya.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/writngs_on_sports/kar"/>   <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/writngs_on_sports/ig"/>   <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/writngs_on_sports/top"/>   <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/writngs_on_sports/at"/><br/></div>
<br/>
We also did some bouldering and climbing in the Mission Trails Regional Park in the Mission Gorge climbing area. I will never forget my first experience of climbing there - it was my first time in "desert" conditions. There was a nice breeze but temperatures were still high. We took off our t-shirts and of course went home with red and painful backs. We went there a few times and had a lot of fun doing some unnamed, unrated (at least for us - we didn't care about that) bouldering problems just for pure joy. The granite rock was a welcome contrast to the limestone/conglomerate I usually climb on and I really liked making some fun moves on the flakes of these rocks...<br/>
<br/>
This happened three or four years ago. A recent reunion with Atulya in New York brought it back to mind when we both witnessed our spiritual teacher, <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>, perform a <a href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy/athletic_achievements/256lbwristcurl">256lb wrist curl</a> in each arm and a 740lb double arm lift. Sri Chinmoy tries through weightlifting to inspire his fellow man to greater things. This reunion inspired me to write about the fond memories I had with the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team from San Diego with hope to visit them soon...<br/>
