<p><tt><span class="c3">So far I have had two memorable visits to the Croatian climbing Mecca</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>of</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Paklenica. I went there for the first time in May last year with</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>Sasko, a friend of mine from the Macedonian Climbing Association, and</tt> <tt>I was very surprised and inspired by the concentrated climbing</tt> <tt>vibration and atmosphere that exists in this famous National Park.</tt> <tt>Having had a long ride there by car we arrived without sleep early in</tt> <tt>the morning, eager to see where the big routes are. There was not a s</tt><tt>oul to be seen, but we knew that during the day it would be full,</tt> <tt>judging by the cars from all over Europe in the nearby town of</tt> <tt>Starigrad and the number of tents we saw in the local car-camps.</tt><br/></span></p>
<div class="c7"><span class="c4"><img class="c5" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/anica" height="349" width="275"/>   <img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/dusan" height="237" width="202"/></span></div>
<div class="c7"/>
<p><span class="c4"><span class="c8">-NW Face Anica Kuk</span>                   </span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>As we had guessed, at around 7-8 am climbers were getting an early</tt> <tt>start on</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the big routes of Anica Kuk, which rises up around 350 meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">in its</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">middle section. We pitched our tent</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">one of the camps (in the only</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">remaining place left) and we bought the local guidebook</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>and started looking up at the many different routes from the parking</tt> <tt>lot. There were so many climbers; I had the impression that when I was</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">up there I would turn and have a look around and always find someone</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing beside me. Even small children in groups of 5-6 were making</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">their first climbing moves under their instructor's eye. It was just</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing, climbing and climbing...</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Since both of us are interested in climbing long routes we </tt> <tt>immediately started looking at the routes of Anica Kuk's North-West</tt> <tt>Face. That day we decided to go on a route that was a "must" in the</tt> <tt>guidebook - Mosoraski. The guidebook told us that this 350 metre climb</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">was the best introduction for the rock and for the height as it was one</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of the longest climbs but not very hard. Luckily, there were not many</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">parties in front of us, so following only a party of two we were</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">enjoying the view of the whole area. It is something that I could never</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">describe.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>The rock was fairly solid (in comparison to the limestone</tt> <tt>that we have in Macedonia) and only the friction moves were a little</tt> <tt>strange at the beginning (at first it was like there was no friction)</tt> <tt>but I sort of got used to it after a while.</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">The crux of the route is rated V; it was OK, an easy V. It is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">situated in the last rope-length and it was a little exposed at that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">height but with a few moves we were out of it and enjoying the scene of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the setting sun over the Adriatic.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>The next day we went on the North Face of the same area where the</tt> <tt>shorter routes are located. The route that we wanted to climb was named</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Ljubljanski, it is 250 meters long and being a Slovenian route (like</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">most of the routes there) we expected something more serious then the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day before. The crux was rated VI+ and it was in the V/VI region for</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">most of the time. It was a demanding route and it was a very fulfilling</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">feeling when we finished it. When we came down it was still around noon</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">- still time to to do another one so we picked up the short route</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">called Zgreseni in the Stub area. This is a route that goes diagonally</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">up to the right following a crack with a crux of VI- and it is about</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">150 meters long. The crux is with a bigger distance between the bolts -</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">it is a strange move that demands hand strength and I realized</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that you just have to move through it quickly instead of trying to find</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">some easier way out of the problem using your mind. This route is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">called Zgreseni which means Mistaken - it was named because a party</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that wanted to do a repeat climb of the real route (that is few meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the left and also follows a crack but goes much higher), but they</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made a wrong</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">choice of a crack and thus ended up being the first party to climb this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>At the end of it we went to a place where we could watch the routes on</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the NW wall; we wanted to go on the Velebiteski route the next day. It</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is also a famous one - but hard. Sustained difficulties with a crux of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">VII- on a 350m high route - the description inspired us the moment</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">when we read it. The next morning when we arrived there was a group of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">4 Czech climbers about 5 meters to the right from our route. When we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">opened the guide book and started talking about the route they realized</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that they were not on the route they wanted to be.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>So the leading climber came down and asked if they could go ahead</tt> <tt> in front of us. We agreed, thinking they would move quickly. They</tt> <tt>started climbing; they had one climber (the best one among them)</tt> <tt>leading the route, the second climber following up securing both the</tt> <tt>first one who would continue and the third one who was starting up</tt> <tt>towards him - an incredibly slow method. This was something I've never</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">seen before. At any one time this group was taking 3 pitches of the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route. Sasko and I looked at each other and couldn't believe it; we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">decided we had to pass this Czech train. The Czechs accepted this</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>readily enough, realizing that otherwise no-one would be able to climb</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">that route that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day. So climbing on a difficult terrain and almost moving together</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbers, we were ahead of them after the fifth or sixth pitch. The</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route is situated almost in the middle of the big wall and it is very</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">exposed, especially on the slabs on the upper half. Very hard and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">strenuous. The moves were very demanding and we were happy to be out</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of it.</span></tt></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>However, with all the hard work done, I lost my concentration for a</tt> <tt>second</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">a</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">s I was releasing the rope out of the belay device - I dropped</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the device instead of the rope and I could only watch as it hit the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">wall below me a few times and disappeared. When I came to my partner I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">told him I had two pieces of news: some good news and some bad news.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">The good news: we had passed the hardest pitches in the route and we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">had only 2-3 pitches of III/IV grade ahead. The bad news: I lost</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the belay-device. To be honest, it is not something that bad (only if</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">you have to rappel down - but even then) because you can belay by other</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">means; I just wanted to share the joke because we had been having a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">good climb and I was feeling really satisfied at that moment. Once out</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of the route, we remained on the top for a while, partaking of the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">water and fruit that we had brought in our backpacks.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/></span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>The next day was our last day there and we wanted to climb something</tt> <tt>long again (but easy) so we went on the first route that was made on</tt> <tt>this wall - a route called Brahmov. This route is fairly easy with</tt> <tt>only one pitch that is with a crux of VI- (or IV with A1) but long</tt> <tt>about 300 meters. When we came to the stance at the beginning of that</tt> <tt>hard pitch which is somewhere in the middle after a longer traverse to</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">it we thought that we had the right line to follow, but what hung</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>us was something that didn't look VI-. Sasko suggested that maybe we</tt> <tt>had to go a little more to the right but there were no pitons or bolts</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">over there so we stayed there; it was hard and we had a problem moving</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through it even using the IV, A1 variation. When we were out of this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitch we saw that it was from the other route and we indeed had to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">move</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">more to the right, but again we were on easy ground so it was fine. On</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the top we savoured the mountaintop view of the Adriatic for the last</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">time and went down. When we came down we looked in the guidebook and we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sow that that pitch was from (I don't remember the name) another route,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which was 2 grades harder. We had a good laugh about this and we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">started</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">getting ready for home.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Second time I went there with my dear friends Mukul from Israel, Dusan</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">from Slovakia and Ekalabhya from Macedonia (with whom I climbed on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3"><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/frendo">Frendo</a> few days before). It was October and we met in Vienna, Austria</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the two concerts that <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> gave there on his European tour</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">2004. Sri Chinmoy that year also gave concerts in Prague and Budapest.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">These concerts certainly refilled our batteries after the arduous</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climb in the Alps. Sri Chinmoy played numerous instruments the sound of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which still echo inside me even now as I am writing this text a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">months later. Inspiring moments like these awaken a sense of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fulfillment in my heart and keep me in a spiritual mood that is as hard</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">to explain as it is hard to explain why we climb. I always remember</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">this poem by Sri Chinmoy:</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/></span></p>

<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>This was first time that this group had gone climbing together on some</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">long routes so we did not experiment much with new routes - we tried</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the easy (longer) route called Nosorog, but then we did Mosoroski and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Zgreseni which I knew from my previous visit. The rest of the time we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">had a lot of sport climbing which was Dusan's specialty where he was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">trying some hard moves also.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Paklenica is a place where you can climb in whatever condition you are</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">in because of the wide choice of routes - long and short routes, a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">wide range of technical difficulties, most of the routes are bolted,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and it's in a scenic area so close to the sea... It is a place that I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">would certainly recommend for rest after some hard climbing on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">alpine-style faces - in the pleasant atmosphere I easily forgot the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">promise I gave myself in the Alps, hanging on some wall hundreds of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">metres over ground, that I would never do something this crazy</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">again.....</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>

            <p class="documentDescription">...The spiritual way</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p><tt><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK">While <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>'s students have run ultramarathons, swum the</span></tt> <span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>English Channel and broken world endurance records in numerous</tt> <tt>fields, one feat of endurance has so far eluded them: climbing Mount</tt> <tt>Everest. If one intrepid group has its way, however, this might be</tt> <tt>next on the list.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Of course, it will be no small achievement. Though more people have</tt><tt>climbed Everest over the past 50 years than have swum the Channel,</tt> <tt>the height of 8,850 metres (29,035 feet) still seems an almost</tt> <tt>mythical quest (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/high14">The Highest 14...</a>).</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>One of the most experienced climbers on the team is New Yorker</tt> <tt>Anugata B., who has swum the Channel, completed several</tt> <tt>ultramarathon races, and run across the Sahara Desert. "I think the</tt> <tt>Channel gave me the confidence to climb mountains," he says.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Though he swam the Channel back in 1988, mountain-climbing had</tt> <tt>intrigued him since his childhood, when he was watching National</tt> <tt>Geographic specials on TV. "I remember one in particular where they</tt> <tt>were climbing the Alps. I think it was Walker Spur. I remember being</tt> <tt>absolutely floored by watching it. I wasn't saying at the time that</tt> <tt>I wanted to do that, but it really struck a chord inside of me."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Here, he reveals his techniques for what might yet be his greatest</tt> <tt>achievement – techniques which have their basis in his spiritual</tt> <tt>life.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Play to your body's strengths</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>Part of his interest in mountain-climbing, he says, is due to his</tt> <tt>body's physical traits. "My physical body's made for endurance, as</tt> <tt>opposed to high-intensity sports like sprinting or even high-level</tt> <tt>rock climbing."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Climb with friends who have the same goal</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>These climbers were already long-time friends. "We've all been <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri</a></tt> <tt><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Chinmoy</a>'s meditation students for a very long time, on average about</tt> <tt>25 years," says Anugata, "so we were meditating and pursuing other</tt> <tt>sports well before the four of us ever started climbing.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"We realised we had a similar goal: to climb a high mountain, and to</tt> <tt>really experience the atmosphere and the consciousness of the</tt> <tt>mountain. Especially the Himalayas, because it's the traditional</tt> <tt>seat of meditation for yogis who meditate in caves.</tt> <tt>The combination of the sporting life and the spiritual life, in an</tt> <tt>environment like that, is really, really satisfying."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Meditate</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>Anugata meditates every day. "The actual act of meditation – sitting</tt> <tt>down and really silencing your mind, that real inner stillness – is</tt> <tt>not so easy. At least, not for long periods of time, given the</tt> <tt>intense activity of the Western lifestyle. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has always</tt> <tt>used athletics to augment the meditative experience."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Anugata and his friends see mountain-climbing as a spiritual</tt> <tt>experience. Take their expedition to Mount Cho Oyu, which is near</tt> <tt>Everest. At 8,201 metres (26,906 feet), it is the world's sixth</tt> <tt>highest peak (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/high14">The Highest 14...</a>).</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"We had a puja [ceremony] before we started. We meditated at base</tt> <tt>camp every day. We tried to make it a pilgrimage, not just an</tt> <tt>'attack' on the mountain – a word that some people use. We were in</tt> <tt>Tibet, and we really wanted to feel our oneness with Tibet, with the</tt> <tt>villages and people, and just continue that feeling right up the</tt> <tt>mountain. We didn't have any porters or any help climbing. It was</tt> <tt>just four of us – and our cooks, down at base camp. We all made it</tt> <tt>to the top.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"The consciousness up at the top, when you're walking around with</tt> <tt>low oxygen, is just not earthly. It's more like being in an</tt> <tt>airliner, when you look out the window in the morning, except</tt> <tt>there's no plane. Living in that environment for several weeks, it</tt><br/>
<tt>was really easy to meditate out there."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Build up to your goal</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>The same advice applies to almost everything. Anugata has taken many</tt> <tt>years, with several sub-goals on his way to the main one.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"If you're mountaineering, it's not a question of just bagging a</tt> <tt>peak, then going home and telling people what you did. That's</tt> <tt>probably part of it, but you've got to pay your dues, just like</tt> <tt>anything in life. You have to decide this is a priority and go about</tt> <tt>it in a conscious way. If you want to climb higher altitudes, like</tt> <tt>the 8000-foot peaks, start at lower altitudes and work up.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"I'd been climbing about 12 years at that point, maybe two or three</tt> <tt>trips a year. I was just practising in and around New York, or going</tt> <tt>to South America or China or Alaska. The four of us had done various</tt> <tt>things that led us to believe that we could handle this 8000-metre</tt> <tt>climb in low oxygen.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"First you learn how to handle the altitude and perhaps take care of</tt> <tt>yourself. You have to be prepared for what happens with the weather</tt> <tt>– unexpected storms and things like that. You have to be prepared</tt> <tt>for the incredible cold at 8000 metres. That cold is really due to</tt> <tt>the lack of oxygen. When you get up between 7000 metres and 8000</tt> <tt>metres, there's not much oxygen in your body. It's not burning and</tt> <tt>producing a lot of heat, so you have these down suits and a lot of</tt> <tt>insulation. You have to be very careful to take care of your</tt> <tt>appendages – your hands, your nose, your toes. So that's another</tt> <tt>aspect of being prepared.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"There's a little bit of technical climbing, and as you soon as you</tt> <tt>progress high enough and start to do vertical rock climbing, it's</tt> <tt>really a heavy-duty thing. It really comes from meditation… without</tt> <tt>letting any negative emotion get in there, and just for the moment,</tt> <tt>always being the best that you can be. That's going to be,</tt><br/>
<tt>ultimately, your best achievement.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"Half of mountaineering is taking care of yourself. You can't really</tt> <tt>expect someone, even if it's your guide, to come up to you at every</tt> <tt>moment and say, 'How ya doing?' They may say that, but you might not</tt> <tt>be able to tell them how it really is going. It's really important</tt> <tt>to pay into the sport, but responsibly – I want to stress the word</tt><br/>
<tt>'responsibly' – get to the point where you can climb at that level."</tt><br/>
<br/>

<div class="c5"><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt class="c6">Make climbing part of your life-philosophy</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>"When you spend a long time in an activity, you tend to get inside</tt> <tt>the activity and inside yourself," Anugata says. "You just have more</tt> <tt>time to let the higher experience happen."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>However, this should happen naturally. The activity itself comes</tt> <tt>first. "It's become a philosophy as I've gotten older, but I think</tt> <tt>philosophy starts as something you just do physically. The</tt> <tt>philosophy gets built around it.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"In a zen sense, you get into the actual activity. Visiting</tt> <tt>remote places, the pure living out in the mountain drinking the</tt> <tt>glacier water, is just something that you feel satisfied doing. If</tt> <tt>you get to the summit of the peaks that you want to, that's a plus."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Prepare yourself for the power of the mountain</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>"It's easy to get a magazine about climbing and get some pictures of</tt> <tt>the people on Everest or one of the other 8000-metre peaks. You see</tt> <tt>people climbing, but what you don't get is the tremendous vibration</tt> <tt>of the place, which is really soulful.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>In that area of the world – Tibet, Nepal and Pakistan – where the</tt> <tt>really high mountains are, you get this feeling of tremendous power</tt> <tt>in the atmosphere. It's almost tangible. At the same time, you're</tt> <tt>feeling this inner strength. But the physical body is really</tt> <tt>struggling. You look at photos of people climbing… but you don't</tt> <tt>really get a feeling of what they're experiencing."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>When you follow in their footsteps, of course, it all becomes clear.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"You see that you're made up of various elements. You're not just</tt> <tt>the body. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has always taught us that there's the physical</tt> <tt>body, the vital energy, the mental energy, the heart power and the</tt> <tt>soul's power, and you start to see that separation when you get into</tt> <tt>very difficult athletic situations. The great art of meditation</tt> <tt>helps to clarify what's going on."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Do it with the greatest motives</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>This is an experience to be savoured – not just reaching the goal,</tt> <tt>but every part of the activity. "If you don't really enjoy it,</tt> <tt>there's not a great chance that you'll get to the top, because</tt> <tt>you're talking about a couple of months of approach and climbing,</tt> <tt>and there's definitely hardship involved."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>But while the activity might be difficult, Anugata says, enjoying it</tt> <tt>is a simple task. "The Everest climb might not even be your highest</tt> <tt>moment. Personally, I've had many of my own greatest moments. Many</tt> <tt>of them are not on the top of the mountain. Some of them are side</tt> <tt>issues to the climb. You can never tell when that moment of grace is</tt> <tt>going to descend on you. You're looking at the world with a new set</tt> <tt>of eyes.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"Getting ready, and taking the responsible steps to climb in the</tt> <tt>Himalayas, is just part of that. It's a whole path. We have a</tt> <tt>meditative path, and this is another path that is built around the</tt> <tt>meditative path.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"It's more about trying to see God within the world. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>'s</tt> <tt>philosophy is that he tries to see God's existence within the world.</tt> <tt>To get a glimpse of that is to get a foothold in that awareness. It</tt> <tt>requires us to try to silence ourselves, and get insight into what</tt> <tt>we are doing."</tt><br/>

            <p class="documentDescription">18/19 September 2004 - North Face of Aiguille du Midi by the route "Frendo Spur"</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<h3>Climbing up the North Face of Aiguille du Midi</h3>
<br/>
The many visitors that make the pilgrimage to the famous ski resort of Chamonix, France only have to look high up in the surrounding mountains to see the North Face of Aiguille du Midi. A short trip by lift gives them a unique opportunity to see every detail of all the major climbing routes, and sometimes one can even make out on the rockface the tiny spots of the climbers in action. During last year’s Alpine trip, I beheld the north face of Aiguille du Midi, and since then whoever asked me my plans for the next season was told emphatically that I want to go on Frendo, the imposing buttress that rises up almost straight through the middle of the big wall of Midi.<br/>
<br/>
The buttress is named after the Frendo-Rionda party, who did the first ascent by this route on 11 July 1941, followed twenty-three years later by the first winter ascent by the Stagni-Wohlschlag party on 21-22 January 1964. Our climb began on the seventeenth of September, 2004, when myself and my climbing partner, Ekalabhya, took what we needed for this climb up on to the glacier where we wanted to camp in order to have an early start the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/our route"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- The route</span><br/></div>
<br/>
I had spent all year reading as many descriptions as I could find  about the route, looking at some pictures, dreaming about it constantly - I thought that I knew everything there was to know. Maybe I did, but no amount of reading could have prepared me for that moment during our approach to the glacier when the true size of the task ahead dawned on me. 1200 meters of near-vertical rock face awaited us, starting up around 2600m and ending at the 3842 meters high summit. It was such an intimidating sight, and many times during our approach we had to avert our eyes as the the whole thing just became too mind-boggling. Everything that I thought I knew had just gone out the window. It was only when we set up our “base camp” and became occupied with the mundane jobs such as melting water that our anxiety went away and we could look at the route objectively, discussing matters such as where we could go faster and where we might have problems.<br/>
<br/>
We didn’t start particularly early the next morning and it wasnt untill 8:00am that we arrived under the rock itself, after a one-hour approach from our tent. The bergschrund (crevasse between the face and the glacier) was quite big and there was only one place were we could easily go on the rock. Up until now we had been quite calm and collected, but now we could see the true size of the rock features now that we were up close, and I was overwhelmed by the magnitude of it all. The north faces of the Alps are very cold during the whole day. At the beginning every touch on the rock was very uncomfortable but we were concentrating only on the climbing itself and after some time we forgot about the cold.<br/>
<br/>
We were climbing without any rest stops, trying to make our first bivouac place as high as possible, bearing in mind the last lift down from the mountain the next day left at 5:00pm. We didn’t have any problems finding our way on the rock - there was only one real route up, along the ridge, on either side of which there were only abysses and hold less slabs. From time to time we would find some leftovers from other climbing parties: cams, nuts, slings, a few pitons…<br/>
<br/>
The only problem was to get higher. But, not having acclimatized at all, we were moving increasingly more slowly the higher we ascended. Just before it got dark, we came under a vertical pillar that was raising four or five rope lengths up. We decided to sleep there,as we were unsure as to whether there was any better place to sleep further on. The sleep wasn't brilliant, to say the least. It got to the point when we would wake up because of the cold, wriggle around to warm up enough to go back to sleep, only to wake up again, and again...<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, the buttress rising up right in front of us did not seem half as scary as it was when we approached it from the glacier the day before. We knew where we should go, so we went. From that moment on the technical difficulty level of the climb was raised a notch or two and there was one or two times I really regretted not bringing my climbing shoes with me instead of the big plastic boots that I had. But once we started to encounter the parts with snow, I was more glad I brought my boots. We had been climbing for what seemed like ages and yet we still couldn’t see the start of the section where the rockface become covered completely in snow and ice. We changed the lead for what seemed like countless times. Finally we came to the snow arête where we could put on our crampons. From there we could see the station at the summit and we were confident that we would make it there before five o’clock. But it did not happen that way...<br/>
<br/>
In all the descriptions that I read, there was almost nothing written about the first two thirds of the route; it was this ice-arête that took all their attention, and when they were writing about the ice-arête you got the impression they were really inspired. And I couldsee why. The arête was so steep on both sides that we were basically crawling on it a few steps at time. The only way that we could belay ourselves was that if one of us were to fall the other one was supposed to jump down the other side of the arête! On the both sides abysses led down to the rocks and from there to the glacier 900 meters below. Understandably, we were very cautious.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/ice"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- Igor starting the lead on the ice</span><br/></div>
<br/>
At one point we started traversing to the right because we wanted to go around the rognon- the rock that stretched all the way to the top. There we climbed on ice belaying with ice-screws. It was dark and the ice slope grew steeper as we went up. At one point when it was my turn to belay Ekalabhya to come to me, the slope was so steep I couldn’t stand normally and I had to hang on the ice-screws. We were joking that it was good that it was dark we would probably be not so relaxed if we could see where we were.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, we were only climbing and climbing, undisturbed by the height, the steepness, what lay to the right or left of us; only the cold disturbed us. I would climb to my stance and shiver uncontrollably whilst I was waiting for Ekalabhya to come to me and continue climbing another rope-length. When I saw my gloves frozen solid, I just had to laugh at the situation we were in.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Ekalabhya about the time and he said that it was exactly midnight. From then on, we continued climbing in silence. We just wanted to reach the end. We reached an area laden with crevasses. I was supposed to lead that part; I pointed the light of my headlamp in all directions but I couldn’t see any logical way to go. In the end, I just picked a direction and went because I didn’t want to stay in one place too long. I was climbing through very nice forms of ice with some crevasses to one side. When I reached my stance it was such a position that I thought that there is no way back and that we had to push straight. I couldn’t really see what was up there in the dark but I could see the lights at the summit. When Ekalabhya came and continued I could see from his light that we were very close to the top alright but his movements also showed me how bad the terrain was. When my turn came to start up I could see that I was right. The last two rope-lengths were full of hidden crevasses but Ekalabhya did a great job leading the way through and over them.<br/>
<br/>
At last, we reached the summit ridge and I could recognize the terrain. The track for the “White Valley” was going down on the other side and we were only a few minutes walk away to the tunnels of the Midi station.<br/>
<br/>
It was 3:00am when we arrived there. We had been climbing for 30 hours, 18 hours during the second day alone. After five hours we were on the glacier again, collecting our leftover gear and the tent, and happily looking back on route above us; this time our original apprehension had been replaced with a sense of satisfaction at a job well done.<br/>
<br/>
The climb was dedicated with gratitude to <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>.<br/></div>

<p>It is hard to say which is 'the' place of pilgrimage in the climber’s world. There are really so many places that deserve the title, places enchanted with the spirit of the climbing pioneers, names that instill respect and awe in every climber's heart.</p>
<p>Take the Dolomites, for example. A big chapter of the history of the modern rock climbing has been written in these Italian mountains with huge limestone faces and towers, signed by names as Comici, Dibona, Dimai, Preuss, Buhl, Solda, Cassin, Dulfer… Many climbs from the beginning of the 20th century were done here that even today’s climbers with their super-safe and reliable equipment would not dare to repeat, preferring instead to stay under the wall and try to imagine how the fellows from the black and white pictures ever managed it…</p>
<p class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin3" height="465" width="237"/>     <img class="c4" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin4" height="484" width="261"/></p>
<p>Last year I bought a guidebook in Chamonix, France that has the name “Classic Dolomite Climbs”. It is a nice guidebook that has at least one route for every corner of the Dolomites - a total of around 100 routes. Over the past year I have been reading through this book - each time after a few minutes I would get a headache trying to decide where I would actually like to climb...</p>
<p>For this first visit I decided on the routes concentrated around the Falzarego Pass – a mountain pass about 15km from the town of<br/>
Cortina d’Ampezzo where together with my wife, Vesna, we had our “base camp” in one of the town’s camping sites.</p>
<p>Thinking when we should go, the best invitation came – <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> was about to give three concerts in Italy at the end of May in Milano and Torino so we decided to head towards the mountains after these concerts. We were eagerly waiting for these concerts and for this visit of <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> in Europe - every time we came close to this spiritual Master we get so much inspiration by his selfless work to inspire everyone to reach deeper in their own lives. His concerts - where he plays on numerous instruments and sings songs that he has composed in his native Bengali language - are the best inner food that we could get for our planned trip.</p>
<p class="c5"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin1"/>      <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin2"/></p>
<p>After the concerts we headed towards Cortina and there we made our plan of when we are going to do the selected climbs that were:</p>
<p>Mountain (height) - route (name)<br/>
1. Sass di Stria (2477m) - South Rib<br/>
2. Torre Picola di Falzarego(c.2500m) - South Arete<br/>
3. Torre Grande di Falzarego (c.2500m) - West Face (Lassato Route)<br/>
4. Piccolo Lagazuoi (2778m) - South-West Face (Via del Buco)<br/>
5. Piz Popena Basso(2224m) - East Face (2 routes)<br/>
6. Cinque Torri (Torre Barancio 2308m) - (2 routes: North Face, and North West Corner)<br/>
7. Punta Fiames(2240m) - South Face (Via Comune)</p>
<p>I don’t like to rush things, and when it comes to climbing in an area  where I am visiting for the first time I like to start from easier ground so that I can gauge the lie of the land, so to speak. For this visit we decided to do easier routes that did not exceed the IV+ grade of difficulty (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). Climbing up to VI on a traditional alpine-style routes in our local crags and a bit harder on a well protected bolted routes - but this and the fact that these routes are termed “classic” might give you the false impression that everything was so easy…</p>
<p>“Climbing in the high mountains is to be enjoyed most when the difficulties (and not just those of a technical nature) are well within one’s capabilities and the mind is free to explore things on a deeper level”… we wanted to live up to this quote taken from the guidebook, and have a nice and enjoyable mountain experience.<br/></p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Cinque Torri, Punta Fiames...</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>6 June<br/>
The weather was still not getting better and it was again cloudy. We decided to wait again on Punta Fiames route and that day we went on Cinque Torri. We chose two routes and they were located on Torre Barancio which top rises up to 2308m height. The first route that we did was on the North Face and it is called “Dibona”. It is graded IV and it has 4 pitches. The second one is the North-West Corner and it was also graded IV with 3 pitches (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). They were both first climbed by the Dibona/Apollonio/Stefani party in September 1934. The difficulties on the first route were located in the fist half where we climbed through well-polished slabs; the intermittent rain was not helping either. But after that the terrain eased up and I ended the last pitch on the Torre Romana from where we made one 50m abseil. I liked the second route much more. It had a sustained difficulty level and again (like the day before) I moved through a well-sized corner/chimney.</p>
<p class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/5t1"/><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/5t3"/><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/5t4"/><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/5t2"/></p>
<p class="c3">- Cinque Torri</p>
<p>The chimney is actually in the crack between the two towers, Torre Barancio and Torre Romana - they are connected at the foot but the higher you go they split very visibly as seen from the second route.. When we finished climbing the first route it started raining and I thought that that would be it for that day. But actually the rain eased up and we decided to do a quick climb of the corner no matter how wet we would get. The moment when we started climbing it stopped raining, and the moment I collected the rope after the abseil it started raining again. It was a special moment, if felt like we were somehow rewarded for our decision…</p>
<p>7 June<br/>
The next morning the skies looked clear. They were much clear and bright and we decided to go on Punta Fiames. The mountain is 2240m high, and the route is on its south face called “ Via Comune”. It is a 400m long route with 15 pitches graded IV+ (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). After the approach (which we had researched a few days earlier) we came under the wall and started looking for the real chimney, at the foot of which it was written that the route starts. I think we started out about 3-4 meters to the left but anyway we came to the first belay stance and from there on, the route finding was easy. I was well absorbed in the climbing of the route and at one moment I felt I knew where the first party would have gone the next pitch, my guess turned out to be correct… It was nice climbing and we liked this route very much also. I must admit that I had doubts whether we should start or not since when we arrived the sky was covered with gray clouds and it looked like it would rain again. But we had delayed enough, and it was the second time we had made the approach – I guess we would have never come for a third time so we just started and later the sky cleared up a little. We both like climbing long routes no matter how easy/difficult they are. We like being exposed on a wall for few hours and being concentrated on the climb and on the difficulties that we are passing through. It is a special moment when you come down in the camp and look at the big face again and remembering how you went through the corner, and then the exposed traverse, then chimneys… I don’t know why – it is simply so. From the top of the route there was a short via ferrata (over fixed steel cord) to the summit from where first over a cairn marked path and then just by orientation we came to the gullies that were scree-filled and after 2 hours we were at our car.</p>

<p>So we did nine routes in eight days during this first visit of ours in the Dolomites. It was a nice experience and we hope to visit this places again very soon since there are so many possibilities in a very vast and real alpine climbing area. We liked it especially because most of the time we were alone and climbing by ourselves in a nice (and sometimes wild) mountain environment was a special experience.</p>

<p>3 June<br/>
Finding the start of the route called “Via del Buco” on the South-West Face of Piccolo Lagazuoi was a little tricky since I recognized the roof in the third pitch looking up from the base of this wall but I was not sure which corner to take since there were two almost close to each other. While going up and down on the scree gully two older Swiss climbers approached the face and came close where I was standing. They didn’t understand a word English but I just mentioned the name of the route and the leader of the party showed me the right hand corner. (There was an orange piton driven in at the start of the left corner, which got my attention). We were ready to start so we went ahead of them and in the first 2-3 pitches they were following us very close. The leader would come at the belay stance while Vesna was belaying…After that they somehow slowed down since the second climber was going slowly but we waited for them at the top and took a picture with us all together because I was very inspired by watching them still climbing at the ages of 53 and 78.  We had a small chat at the top, using my broken German. They reminded me an interview I read with Anderl Heckmair (the leader of the first ascent party of the North Face of Eiger in 1938). He was then 93 years old and answering the question when did he stop climbing, he said “two years ago (when he was 91) because he had some strange pain in the leg…” The whole interview was very inspiring and something that I never forgot…Anderl Heckamer died on 2 February 2005, 98 years old.</p>

<p class="c3">- On Piccolo Lagazuoi</p>
<p>Looking back on “Via del Buco" - it was very satisfying 250metres long route with 10 pitches with all of the climbing moves in the IV grade area (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). You have corners, slabs, overhang, roof and if not satisfied at the end you can always choose the exit 2 pitches graded V+ in a corner which now was dripping wet. Although in the guidebook it says “abundant protection” I would say that you would never regret taking a rack of nuts, cams and slings wherever you go in the Dolomites since here (and I am not blind) I could only find “abundant possibilities for protection”. There was always good enough crack for a cam or a place to put a sling around… Anyway, if climbing IV is well in your abilities you will enjoy the solid rock and keep climbing through the “hold-covered” route of Piccolo Lagazuoi without being bothered whether there is in-situ protection or you have to put it by your self…For the descent we were not sure about the length of the abseil (it is not written in the book) so we climbed with a single rope and Vesna carried another rope in case the abseil is longer then 25m. But there was no need for abseil at all. There is an excellent system of fixed steel cord and a very solid bridge that got us on the old military path that took us on the approach route.</p>

<p>4 June<br/>
The next day we went to find the approach route for Punta Fiames, the most westerly summit in the Pomagagnon group to the north of Cortina. Punta Fiames is a most awe-inspiring sight entering Cortina by car driving from Belluno. The moment I saw it on the picture in the guidebook, I wanted to do it. However, the day was all cloudy and rainy so it was a nice rest day. We couldn’t climb for sure, but we could hike up and check the approach. We parked the car at the hospital complex driving to Olimpia Camping and from there over the meadow we got on the wide path numbered 211. Bearing leftwards we got into a junction point and followed the path 202 that got us through the pine tree forest to the scree from where another junction and a marked path with regular red/white paint (no numbers on it) leads under the South Face of Punta Fiames… At the moment when I got to the very start of the route after about 2 hours approach it started to rain more heavily and we walked (and scrambled through the upper approach chimneys) back. All we needed was a clear day...</p>
<p><br/>
5 June<br/>
During the night it rained heavily and we didn’t want to climb on a wet 400m high rock that looked slabby… But we didn’t want to lose another day's either so we decided to go towards the Lake Misurina and climb on the nearby Piz Popena Basso. This is a 2224m high mountain where on its East Face we climbed 2 routes. The first one (graded IV+, length 120m) was first climbed by Mazzorana/Adler party on 17 August 1936, and the second one (graded IV, length 130m) was first climbed by Piero Mazzorana on 23 September 1931. They both had 4 pitches. We parked the car on the parking of the Misurina Hotel and after about 45 minutes got under the routes. This was the first time when we met local Italian climbers. It was good that they came after us since 2 parties (5 people) were climbing the first route that we wanted to do and we saw they were still there when we finished it and were at the foot of the wall searching for the start of the second route. Both routes were easy - there was a nice exposed traverse and an easy overhang of IV at the first one. As for the second one, all that I can say is – chimneying. Although the route starts following a corner, my abiding memory is of the chimneys. I really liked them. They were perfectly sized (not too narrow or wide) and climbing at that grade I started to like chimneying again. I found the rock more slippery somehow and there were also a few overhangy slabs and cracks that for a moment made me think that they should perhaps be graded a half-grade more, but it is OK. Good holds – just have to stretch and find them and here there was enough in-situ protection, especially on the crux points. Even knowing this I would advise you to take some slings and nuts, you will at least feel more confident…</p>

<p><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> gave the last concert in Torino on 30th May. We spent the night in the camp in the town and early in the morning we departed towards Cortina d’Ampezzo (via Venice and Belluno). Driving through highways all the way from Skopje we saw only plain fields and roads but when we started driving from Belluno towards Cortina the mountains started to show up and I started getting excited about the climbs getting so close. It was very satisfying finally driving through the scenic mountain roads and villages of Northern Italy and seeing the big walls of the mountains and towers rising out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/cort"/></p>
<p class="c3">- Cortina d'Ampezzo and the surrounding mountains</p>
<p>The period end of May / start of June is what is called “early” season in the Dolomites for climbing. The South sides of the mountains were clean of snow (as were all our chosen routes) but on the northern slopes there was still some snow to be found – especially in the steep and narrow gullies where we were supposed to pass on our way down. It was also off-season in the town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. When we arrived, the town was empty with only few people on the streets, many shops were closed due to “holidays” (for a month) and out of five camps only 2 were open. We settled down in the Cortina Camping and decided that next<br/>
day we would start our climbing.</p>
<p>31 May<br/>
Few routes had a start from the Falzarego Pass that is about 15km away from the town. This mountain pass is on 2117m height and we drove on the curved road from Cortina with a doubtful feeling about the weather since it was cloudy and grayish. As we arrived on the pass and looked towards Sass di Stria, the route we wanted to climb that day, we saw its top covered in clouds. Deciding to climb it anyway, we parked the car on the road towards Valparolla Pass where there is a small parking place “marked” with a big boulder on the left side. From here, there is a path that leads to the route that passes under the wall of the mountain and we came at the start in about 20 minutes. The start was marked with a driven in piton on the right side of the rib and putting the guidebook in my upper pocket of the backpack, after a moment of silence and concentration I headed up. The South Rib was first climbed by the Cobertaldo/Pezzoti party on 1 August 1939. It is an easy IV+ route (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>) that follows the right side of the rib with occasional turns on right (passing under harder, overhang-like problems) and one rightwards traverse on the last pitch over a big ledge that got us under the crux of the route – a IV+ crack that leads to the top. It was a good introduction route for the Dolomites. We used it to check out if the gradings in the guidebook are as same as or close to the gradings that we climb on our local crags and to feel the rock. In the first two pitches I felt the rock a little slippery but we got used to it very fast and what satisfied us as far as we have climbed on limestone this rock was very solid and firm. We liked it a lot. When we got on the top we had a very nice look towards the surrounding valleys and mountains and also we could see the Falzarego Torres that we wanted to do next.</p>

<p>1 June<br/>
This day we wanted to do 2 routes on the Two Torres di Falzarego that are c.2500m high. The route that we wanted to climb on Torre Piccola di Falzarego was on the South Arête, first climbed by Comici/del Torso/Varale party on 10 August 1934. It was graded IV+ and it had 7 pitches. The route on Torre Grande di Falzarego was on the West Face and was first climbed by S. Lussato on 13 August 1957. It was graded IV and it had 4 pitches. We wanted to do these routes in one day since when abseiling down from Torre Piccola we would come into the gap between the two towers and after short scramble in the gully we would be directly at the start of the other route. We parked the car about 1km before Falzarego Pass driving from Cortina at the parking of a restaurant and after a walk of about an hour we were at the start of the Piccola route. When I was ready to start I had a quick look at the watch that I had in the pocket of my backpack and it said 10:30. The route starts on a ledge about 10 meters to the right from the arête and after 2 pitches of IV/IV+ joins the arête. It was written that it starts under a painted number “10” – I could only see the painted number about 10 meters up from the ledge and it was only when I looked up the face standing at the foot of the chimney that is located at the far left side of this ledge that I saw it… Anyway, at the harder pitches there was enough in – situ protection and only the first 3 pitches were “the harder ones”. I would like to say that even when someone says that there is enough protection on some Dolomite route, you should always bring some slings and nuts because if you are not used to climb with in-situ protection on bigger distances you may find it “tricky”. After that it was easy climbing on grade III+ and we came to the top. There we saw few cemented belay bolts but the actual abseil station was located on a path few meters from the top when we looked down towards Torre Grande. From there we made a 25m abseil that brought us on a terrace from where we were supposed to go into the gap between the Torres… As we sorted out the gear in the backpacks, I looked at the watch and it said 15:30… 5 hours?!?! I could not believe my eyes. I told Vesna about this and we sat in silence for a while. We climbed the route without having almost any problem of route finding and it was all somehow much faster… We decided to go down.</p>

<p class="c3">- Falzarego Pass and the two Torres di Falzarego</p>
<p>When we came to the car there was one Italian climber (we climbed with him when he visited Macedonia) with a friend who said that he was surprised seeing us down instead of climbing another route since it was only 13:30. Now I could not believe my ears; I checked my watch and it said 16:30. After getting into the car I realized this watch had two timers (during the climb I probably unknowingly pressed the button for the timer to change…), and because I hardly ever used the two timers I completely forgot about them - and to make things worse, we could have easily climbed the other route also… Our friends climbed Sass di Stria that afternoon and Vesna and I went to find the start of a route that we wanted to do on Picolla Lagazuoi. We went that night for pizza and decided that we would have another try tomorrow  – with Vesna I would go on Torre Grande and our friends would repeat the route that we did today. We showed them the description, told them all they needed to know and the next day we split half way on the approach route and headed towards Torre Grande.  We saw where this route started the day before, so it was an easy start and easy climbing. The crux slabs were blackened with water, which made them slippery, but it was not a big problem since the route was short and this was only for about few meters. After an easy scramble of II/III at the last pitch we were on the top and we sat<br/>
relaxed for a while.</p>
<p>2 June<br/>
We cast our eyes towards Lagazuoi, since we wanted to do a route there and also towards Tofana di Rozes. We wanted to do 2 routes on this big mountain also but the conditions there were still bad. The exit route was still much under snow and a few friends who were hiking there the day before told us said a big avalanche came off passing very close to them. The south face during the days while we were there was always covered with clouds and we could not see as much as half of the wall. Coming down from Torre Grande was tricky. We put all our equipment in our backpacks since in the guidebook it was written that we have to “descent a short, chossy gully to a notch…from there less distinct path”… We thought this means an easy scramble down, but the gully was very exposed with walls going way down from each side and it was tricky climbing down through a very broken terrain. There were cemented rings, which we could use for abseil or mid-belay points coming down roped together but we didn’t want to take off the equipment from the backpacks so we moved very slowly and it was OK… On the way down we met with the two friends of ours – they came out mid way of the Piccola route since there were few parties climbing slowly in front of them. At Torre Piccola just when you will pass the first 3 pitches there is a ledge from where you can descend to a path that will get you on the approach route…So this was the third route that we did and for the next day we planned to do a route on Piccola Lagazuoi with which we would make a climb on all the mountains that are around Falzarego offered in the guidebook. We were having nice climbing but we were not very happy about the weather since every afternoon the sky would get covered with clouds and we couldn’t make a brave decision to climb something much longer the next day not knowing how the weather would go. Each morning when we would see that the sky had not so many clouds, we would go and climb this short routes but later in the day the weather would change (while climbing we could see how the clouds were coming over from the west) and it was raining almost every afternoon or night. But we decided to climb the 250m high wall of the Piccolo Lagazuoi anyway since it was not that big and the route was fairly easy, at least in the<br/>

<p><span class="c4">-The approaches</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>There are two ways to approach the routes - one by climbing up over to</tt></span></p>
<tt><span class="c3">the top and following a marked path that leads down over at times</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>difficult ground, or the second way over the highway.</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">There are two tunnels on the highway (about 500m after the junction for</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the town) and after passing the first one there is a little stream on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the right that goes towards the river where you can find a fixed steel</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cord so that you can traverse towards the routes. Usually we take the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">second approach because it is much faster and safer, but when the river</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is too high, we go around taking the other way. Getting down is easy.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">From the top there is a trail that leads down to the highway and from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>there into the town, but because it is not very well marked we</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">followed</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the ridge which then met up with the trail - from there on it was easy.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<tt>With Vesna</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">we</span> <span class="c3">have climbed 4 routes in this area - Tulumba,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Polzav, Slavkova and Blazeva. Vesna also has climbed the route Vlatceva</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with another climber. Tulumba and Polzav are two of the longest</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">existing routes. They start close to each other and have a common exit</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">– they share the last pitch. The grades in these routes are up to V but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">they are concentrated mainly in the first two pitches and in the last</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">one. The last third of the first pitch of Tulumba has one overhang</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which I passed using one little rock that was stuck in the wide crack</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cutting the upper part of the overhang in half. Usually when you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climb on</span> <span class="c3">harder rocks these moves give you real joy because of their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">unusual quality, but not here - climbing in such a fragile environment</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made me feel a little queasy about having to use this kind of handhold.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>But this was the only way, so first I put a sling around the rock for</tt> <tt>protection and after that I grabbed the rock, pulled on it, and moved</tt> <tt>on as quickly as I could. The first pitch on Polzav also finds you</tt> <tt>under a small overhang. I had to combine</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the handholds for my left hand on the overhang with the slab on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right where there were no good footholds at all - I had to climb using</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friction moves and</span> <span class="c3">reaching with my left hand as far as I could over</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the overhang. In both cases it was a real relief when I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">out of it. There were good belay stances above and I secured Vesna –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">she came out of these</span> <span class="c3">“problems” with a smile on her face since she</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could enjoy climbing concentrated only on the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and not worrying about holding on loose pieces of rock. The middle two</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches are easy III scrambling. The routes (like all the others here)</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">do not</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>have enough protection “in situ”, so climbing here means having your</tt> <tt>cams, nuts, slings and pitons prepared. The hardest moves in the routes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">are “clean” – the rock here is not (very) fragile so we were free to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">concentrate only on the moves. It is where the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">are</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">not as high that the terrain and the rock gets more fragile – but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that’s also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">part of the climbing… Vlatceva starts also close to these routes but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">has a more straight line and ends up also more to the right. When you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">look at the rock from the other side of the river the line of the route</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(few meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the right of Tulumba) is visible, following wide and narrow cracks</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">up the rockface…</span></tt>

<p>-Pozav(left) and Tulumba (right)</p>
<p><br/>
<tt>Slavkova is a shorter route that starts somewhere on the half of the</tt> <tt>rock, but much harder and here the crux reaches up to VI+ grade. The</tt> <tt>line of the route is far from “diretissima” - it just starts and goes</tt> <tt>up fearlessly towards the hardest technical</tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulties that are in its way. After some easy scrambling from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">river bank we got under the route which starts following a dehidre and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ends up few meters under the overhangs.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">The first belay stance is actually at the tree on the top of this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">dehidre after which the route goes up the slab and traverse to the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right. After this there is a line that will get you right under the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first overhang. Here the climbers feel (and are) very exposed. The hand</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and foot holds are such a position that we had to move almost lying</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">bodies horizontally in the air, turned sideways on the rock and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stretching over as far as we could to the right. The overhanging area</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is so big that when climbers move through the first overhang they can</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see the ground 200 meters under their legs … The first overhang can be</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed following a crack that moves diagonally to the right towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the second overhang. We made the second belay stance under the second</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhang because there was a drag on the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and I just couldn’t move through something this difficult pulling up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with my hand or body. The correct line goes straight up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the second overhand, but if you want to climb it free without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">using the pitons</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“in situ” for aid climbing but you can’t because it’s just not your</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day, you can go around to the right. We didn’t do this - but I must say</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that I was not successful passing this overhang from the first try</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(even second, third…:) There is enough protection “in situ” through the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhangs and in the area over and under them, but not enough in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first pitch where we used the crack that we followed that is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cam-friendly.</span></tt></p>
<p><img class="c8" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/slavk1" height="175" width="274"/><img class="c9" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/previs" height="169" width="266"/></p>
<p>-Slavkova route and climbers under the second overhang<br/>
<br/>
<tt>Blazeva is easy long route where the crux of grade VI is in the last</tt> <tt>7-8 meters where the route gets a little overhangy. For a route of</tt> <tt>around</tt> <tt><span class="c3">250</span> <span class="c3">metres this means pleasant long climb with beautiful views over the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridges that this route follows. The start is over an easy and wide</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">chimney (IV+/V) with lot of possibilities for putting cams and slings.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">But the rock here is more fragile and I had to be very careful how I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was climbing and what I was holding to because everything that would</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">brake would fall directly down on Vesna through the chimney where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">her belay stance was. After the first pitch there are two or three easy</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of easy II/III scrambling. Here we moved parallel and when we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">got at the point where the route gets more vertical we made the belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stance. From here on it gets a little harder but the rock was very</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hospitable for belay means. The last (very short) pitch has a grade VI</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and it starts on a big terrace where we enjoyed the views on the both</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sides of the canyon. The name “Demir Kapija” actually means “Iron</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Gate”. The canyon is like a gate from one valley to another so being on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a top or close gives you unique opportunity to see how the river curves</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the valleys on the both sides. The last pitch can be also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed by another</span> <span class="c3">variation that goes a little towards to the left</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">where we found big handholds and big cracks for cams (I could see a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">old and rusty pitons on my right that were from the harder variation).</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">These were the only “in situ” protection that we saw in this route.</span></tt></p>
<p><tt><span class="c3"><img class="c10" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/blaz" height="142" width="282"/><span class="c4"><img class="c11" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/abz" height="209" width="287"/></span></span></tt></p>
<p><span class="c4">-The upper part of Blazeva</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>The Demir Kapija area is one of the hottest places in Macedonia (if</tt> <tt>not the hottest), so usually we don’t climb here during the summer</tt> <tt>period. The rock faces south so during the whole day</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">climbers are exposed under the sun and climbing on temperatures high</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">over 40 degrees Centigrade can be very exhausting… Still between the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tunnels, there is enough protection and shade and there are some short</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sport-climbing routes that can be done if it is really hot. There are</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>good places for putting up a tent near the small stream that also</tt> <tt>passes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">through</span> <span class="c3">here.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This was the place where, 7 years ago, I began climbing unprotected big</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">routes and I had to plan the route all by myself. I remember during</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first climb I was so concentrated</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on what I was doing while climbing that I only started noticing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">surroundings after reaching the upper half of the route. During</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first hour or two of climbing I couldn’t see anything else around</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only the gray rock, the forms on it, cracks, hand and footholds - I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">so concentrated climbing and protecting my climbing partner that it was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only after some time that I started seeing the valley. It was like</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being awakened from sleep - looking at the surrounding</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">environment, the river that was passing down there, the train, the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">town. It was like the picture was slowly getting filled piece by piece.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was amazed by this effortless concentration that climbing got me in…</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">In few books written by climbers I’ve read how they compare this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">activity with meditation. Meditation, like climbing, gives you a rare</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">opportunity to analyze</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">yourself and go deep and find your limitations and go over them. I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">remember a quote from one climber (unfortunately I can’t remember who</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that) who said that only when we will climb the mountains that are in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ourselves, the mountains of jealousy, fear, anxiety, only then we will</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">be on the highest mountain of the world…</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This is what <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> says about concentration and meditation:</tt></span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><tt>“…Concentration is the open secret of focusing all one’s attention on</tt> <tt>a particular object or person in order to enter into and have one’s</tt> <tt>identification with that object or person. The final stage of</tt> <tt>concentration is to discover and reveal the hidden ultimate Truth in</tt> <tt>the object of concentration. What concentration can do in our</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">day-to-day life is unimaginable. It most easily separates our heart’s</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Heaven from our mind’s hell so that we can live the constant delight</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and joy of Heaven and not in the perpetual worries, anxieties and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tortures of hell while we are on earth…”</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>“Meditation is man’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering. When</tt> <tt>men’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering meet together man becomes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">immortal in the inner world and God becomes fulfilled in the outer</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">world…It is only through meditation that we can get lasting peace,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">divine peace. If we can meditate soulfully in the morning and receive</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">peace for only one minute, that one minute of peace will permeate our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">whole day…We need meditation because we want to grow in Light and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fulfill ourselves in Light…”</span></tt></p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Day 2 - Aletschgletscher...</p>
<div class="documentBody"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The second day we have another glacier to walk along and then to cross: the biggest (I wish to say “hugest”) glacier in</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Europe</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, the Aletschgletscher. This is the day I will come to know how much the difference between the eight of us who DO have crampons and the many others who DON’T is. These crampons will come in like God’s Grace and will enable us today to do things the others cannot attempt. We will wander freely and wildly about almost anywhere on the glacier, unbound to its stony parts, edges, or sides. We leave the conventional routes. Anyway, there isn’t really any such thing as route, as there are no signs, no footsteps, the glacier changes its face every year, every month, every day and every hour. The small holes left by the spikes of the leader’s crampons are just like the natural snow-holes shaped by a heavily falling wet snow. The ridges are all alike, once you climb onto the top of any of them, they just look like another and yet another frozen giant wave of a petrified ocean framed by snow-covered mountains.</span>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And what is between the ridges is the abysm. Deep cracks. Sometimes man can simply step over, not thinking of the consequences of a false step, sometimes man jumps over, and sometimes they are just far too wide: you better turn back, find another way through. It is a Mynotaurus’ job as it is really a labyrinth and except for the guide’s instinct, orientation skills and comprehensive sight, there is absolutely no other hint or clue on directions.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">When it comes to jumping, it is always of a moment of intensity. A moment of victory over something very ancient that still prevails in man. Everybody can jump a meter, or one and a half even, unless he is seriously blessed or handicapped. But how many can jump one and a half meter without the slightest concern if -very obviously- there is nothing (just a deep gap) between the two ends of that meter? We will belong to the group of those who don’t mind the dark void below and just jump. One more inveterate habit of the human psyche has been overcome. I am grateful to my crampons. Even if I don’t always manage to perfectly land on the top edge of the other side, they get a grip and stick me to the aimed shore, not allowing me to slip down into the crevasse. Oh yes, God’s special spiky Grace comes very handy at this moment. On top of that these jumps remind me of a Zen story that is absolutely applicable to our situation: 'with small steps one cannot cross over a crevasse', said once a master to a disciple when the latter one asked him about how to overcome attachment <i>gradually</i></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<div class="c4"/>
<div class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl1"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl2"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl3"/></span><br/></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At the edge of the glacier, towards the mid-section of it, at the place where the gap between the ice-blocks and the rocky body of a side-peak closes, although still far from the rocks, still balancing gingerly on the crusty back of an immense frozen labyrinth, we start seeing colours! Actually white and grey and only one more colour: blue. Light blue with all its nicest hues and shades. Sky blue, turquoise, cobalt blue, cyanide-like blue, peace-blue, sea-blue and what not? There are myriads of bluish hues each one appearing somewhere in the depths of a crevasse, a breach, a wide gap, a torn mouth of the glacier... Now the ice-sea reveals its nicest face, makes itself unprecedentedly attractive. But if one looks deep into these mystic blue depths, still it is depth, danger and death the one is ought to see.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">This is Maya, the wonderful illusion of beauty and sublime forms, irresistibly drawing man towards herself. I literally have to force myself to keep my eyes on the guide, on the rope, on the next jump between two crevasse-walls, above yet another marvel-blue gap offering the perspective of ten or thirty or more meters of void below my feet. Thank God I was told before how to behave, thank God, my Master had spoken to me about Maya. This time there is no fall, I manage to cross all crevasses, avoid all treacherous snow-bridges and breath-thin ice-layers covering a two centigrade cold running water-stream... I just follow the leader, my eyes alternately moving from his step to the rope and then to my step, I faithfully trudge after him, raise arm, push the ski-stock and the crampons to where he stepped a few seconds before, go alongside small ridges, across crest-like hunches, just follow him silently, and I too am followed silently. The glacier doesn’t manage to devour any of us. One more hour and we reach the point where we cross from ice to rock first climbing down the gap and then up the wall. My crampons have an amazingly good grip on a totally smooth rock face.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Soon we find ourselves amidst a debris of boulders and a road up to some saddle of a mountain. Crampons and rope off, we will just walk up. (Of course this walk doesn’t exactly mean walk, but it is still a safe upward road, with no additional security devices needed, cables being installed through the tougher sections.) Only a hundred meters of altitude difference and we have a more complete, somewhat distant and therefore comprehensive view of the central sections of the glacier and its bend. Breath-taking, exhilarating and challenging. We try to look back to where we have come from, but that is lost somewhere in space. We see however the last one or two kilometre long wandering section of the glacier, the labyrinth we have been in. Thousands of ridges separated by thousands of crevasses, abysses, blue holes to loose yourself in… I feel a sort of self-contempt especially when we shake hands with the group leader and he congratulates us for accomplishing the tough parts without accidents. We thank him on our turn. After all, it was his skills, experience, knowledge of the mountain, instinct of the glacier and above all, attention and patience that dragged us along and across two glaciers in two days. He coils the rope and says nothing. The blueness of a summit-background sky is lost in his eyes, he is thinking of the next trip already...<br/></span></p>
<div class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl4"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl5"/>              <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl6"/></span><br/></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Finally, the hardest lesson comes: we are off the glacier, far from the crevasses, gone through the moraine, rock-climbed one of the walls neighbouring the giant body of the glacier, as we gain height on the slope where thousands of boulders of various size were cast by some titan architect, we see more and more of this 900 meters (2700 feet) thick block of ice and snow AND yet the end is beyond our reach... there remains still slope after slope, half-vertical boulder-fields petrified before a fatal fall, then steep rock and then ice-covered rock and then a fresh-snow-covered avalanche field and only far above all these are the ridges, crests and cols connecting summits and high-points of our earth’s noble back.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The journey doesn’t end until it takes toll even on our absolutely last drop of strength, concentration, patience, swiftness and breath. Had it not been for God’s Grace in form of the guide, the map, the crampons, the avalanches that did NOT launch themselves to rush on us, it would be a total failure I have to report. But God’s Grace is somehow there, at the right place, at the right moment. I am prone to believe that this is our last and only chance... Final lesson for today, you may have a rest now, before embarking again.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">If you suspect that this essay will be about mountaineering you are right. If you think that I am just going to talk about spiritual lessons you are also right. I always felt that the two things can have much in common. And my Master is always obliged to find new ways of teaching me, or summarising whatever I have so far learnt. This is how I plunged deep into snow-white spaces for a couple of days and emerged (or was rather pulled out</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>J</span></span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">from dark hollow crevasses, tied onto a 9 mm rope), utterly addicted to adventure.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">To make readers’ life less miserable, I will try to avoid the technical jargon. I will try to explain things for those who have never tasted this kind of food.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Let’s just pretend it was a dream. <br/></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">So, I see myself on a rainy, gloomy, dark grey, absolutely hopeless Thursday afternoon, sitting on the floor of my office, adjusting crampons onto my snow-proof boots...<br/></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I see myself running to catch a train the same evening, then interminably waiting for another train at midnight in the a deserted railway station of a not so well-known, albeit big west-German city, where only the local pub-fairy and local beggar find me to ask for sponsorship... an offer I generously refuse.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And I see poor me thereafter, pulling myself together before getting off a train and then again getting on two more trains in</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Switzerland</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. Quite a boring dream isn’t it? Imagine, I have seen this quite often in the recent past! Well, that’s the dark side of mountaineering: the distance you have to cover until you reach the mountain. Just like the multitude of lives we have to crawl through till the moment comes for us to see the point in all that.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">So, I see myself again, leaning against the window of a narrow-railway mountain train, feeding myself on the exhilarating, spectacular view of some yet unknown, unsuffered three-four thousand meter high summits... and a glorious rainbow there, no, not up in the sky, but rather down, below our trail, in a blooming early-July valley!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I see myself gasping for air later on at 1900 meters when a determined wave of wind finally comes to my appeal and lifts several layers of fog and mist, unveiling what is known to the present day as the ‘cimborasso’ of alpine climbing, the uttermost challenge in Europe’s mountaineering, the culminating combination of danger and difficulty: EigerMORDwand, the Killing Northern Wall of Eiger, the Monster that claimed so many valuable lives and that destroyed so many flourishing climbing careers and success stories. A place of pilgrimage for me, the poor beginner who would never even venture risking my life at the sheer foot of this disastrously whimsical mountain god! I inwardly bow to the giant and try to get as far as possible before another flock of Japanese or Indian tourists invades every little accessible panorama-viewing corner. No wonder, the place is too popular for it is terribly spectacular, reachable without any physical effort (quite unusual for a place of pilgrimage) AND because Japanese climbers successfully conquered this notorious North Wall in 1969, what more is, they actually opened a new, direct route to the top. Therefore, without exception, every Nipponese visitor will have a picture or video-shot of it, plus one more of his/her own self with the mountain in the background – if the Monster condescends to show its face...

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I am supposed to acclimatise a bit, to get higher and higher very gradually, but there are just toooooo many folks in here, attracted by the easy reach of the Top of Europe, the Jungfraujoch, the highest altitude railway station, post office and Bollywood style restaurant of our continent. So I rather put my gaiters, coat and hat on and rush into another small (and already packed!) train, rudely chasing away all conscience conflicts and emerging ideas about fair ways of reaching high on a mountain (ways that totally exclude vehicles!). I am doing exactly the same thing that these Tourists do –it hurts me, it is painful to the adolescent in me, who would rather die than spare an hour of ascension)!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Then I see myself mesmerised by the Eiger glacier yet a little higher at approx. 2800 meters altitude. It is neither an encouragement nor a hopeful perspective for me, concerned about the venture I am about to start...</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I see myself exiting a tunnel at 3400 meters, quite released that the crowd of tourist slowly ceases to follow the same direction. Oh yes, there is cold and snow outside! They prefer to watch it from behind the huge glass walls of an amazingly well-designed infrastructure in the mainstream of the Swiss Alps.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And then I see myself no more! I actually see a big white blank-out, some patches of golden-white sky gently leaning against an immensity of half-vertical white field... Without my sunglasses in two hours I would go blind! Everything is white and you can literally bite into cosmic radiation and diffuse sunlight...</span></p>

<div class="c5"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/gle"/>             <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/krev"/>             <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/krev1"/></span><br/></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The last thermometer I saw at the meteorological station indicated minus 6 Celsius grades, but I actually feel like walking on an enormous hypocaust system, heated by reflected and direct light as well as plain, unobstructed radiation. I am bound to imagine myself now, as I cross an utterly unknown, mystic field hanging between a four thousand meter high ridge and a glacier with its upper curtain starting somewhat higher than 3500 m. I start walking into the unknown. It’s a walk into white light with a totally reduced physical visibility and cosmos-wide room for inner vision. Yes, the sphere of protons and helium nuclei penetrating this space from the wide and vast Universe. Unfortunately, I have to command halt to the inner vision that perceives now the Supreme being in diamond-shine shapes: all I must see now is but the next sign indicating that I am still heading in the right direction. God knows that I am here, anyway. He, well, for me, the weak but heavy-bodied brown-haired woman in her thirties and her water-proof jacket, he is “she” and this she knows that I am totally alone. Journeying into the unseen something that the marriage of a mountain saddle and a giant glacier can ever offer... “She” knows also that I am neither lonesome, nor unhappy. I am more than the contrary of these.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">She takes good care of me. An inner voice knocks in, gently speaks my mother tongue and commands me: don’t err, don’t improvise. Just go on, without a meter of pacing off-tray. All improvised short-cuts take you to an abyss. I don’t see, but I feel and I remember from seeing the map that at my right is the mountain, the western wall of Moench and at my left there is the slope and crevasses of the Jungfraufirn glacier (which is my goal for tomorrow). And in between there is my shadowless shape wandering on, taking deep breaths of a rarified air and bright-white glow. Without the imminent danger, it would be a feeling I could call “trance”. But this is a rather conscious state of mind. Be sober, be reasonable, don’t make any stupidity. I walk on, trudging in the mildly falling snow and the light of a thousand suns behind its veil.</span></p>
<div class="c7"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">Altitude sickness</span></span></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Unavoidably it comes. After four or five hours in the hut at approx. 3650 meters (11976 ft) it slowly downs on me that I actually have to throw up. Thank God, the hut-owner provided air-sickness bags everywhere. Let us not go more into details, I filled quite a few of them. In clear moments when I refill the eliminated waters of my body and wait for the next attack which doesn’t delay coming, I try to think of my Master and of what he said on altitude sickness. The remedy seems to be the joy of transcending the height-limits. If only my tightly constricted stomach would understand that I AM happy! With a totally emptied belly, no water (as nothing stays in me at this moment!) in my dried-out body and overworked head, what makes me then happy about the sheer fact that I can see nothing but snow and snow-white ridges all around, that I can imbibe this rarified air and densified radiation in minus 6 Celsius grades and in a mild 27 km/ hour wind? My dear unknown friend, who dare infiltrating into my diary, if you have not gotten the mountain virus, you will never understand this… Actually, I don’t understand it either.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">True, a lotus is a kind of flower that likes difficulty, if you think that it grows with tightly, tensely gripped petals in the dirtiest waters, resists this medium all the way through, before it finally pushes its head above and then it doesn’t want to stop until it grows higher than any other water plant... But having this kind of a soul, does it really mean I can only be happy in hardship?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Yet, seemingly and realistically: I am happy here now while throwing up and on the other hand I have a hard fight trying to put things to the right place. Am I meant to do this at all? With my lack of physical capacities and unsportsmanly body how far can I drag myself just for the sake of this yearning for vastness and intensity?</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">If this nausea is the end, if this is what I had fought for...(if this is what I had run uphill for, tortured myself with push-ups for, if this is what I had walked through endless snow-fields for, if this is what I had worked and prayed for)... oh, well, then I guess I better walk down nicely, go home and start playing table tennis instead. I look deep inside myself. To my satisfaction, this glimpse is not limited by the walls of a gym hall and a ping-pong ball flying here and there. No! What lives in my inner eyes is an age-long yearning for distance within sight, for spaces below my feet, for ridges that lead me while I am balancing above a two-sided void. What lives in my inner heart is longing for vastness, for the picture of dozens of blue parallel ridgelines and the wind eternally lifting and dropping clouds. What abides in my inner mind is an unbreakable aspiration always to get higher and higher until one’s vision can encompass the rest of the world in its totality, from above.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">All ailment will have to go away, I am not meant to collapse here, emptied of all physical contents with a pale face! Slowly by slowly I get better. The headache wouldn’t stop for a minute, but at least the next gulp of water doesn’t trigger any volcanic reaction. I am being pulled together, I can think normal, climb down the stairways and up again. It is just the pain in brain that tortures me relentlessly. God, where are you?<br/></span></p>

<div class="c5"/>
<p class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Then all of a sudden four Gods walk in. None of them less than six feet tall, the cream of British Lake District climbers makes an appearance here after having successfully climbed Moench, the brother</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">mountain</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">of</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Eiger</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. They were the four men in black – nearing the summit – I saw from the col of the mountain this afternoon! In seconds the deserted, empty entry hall becomes a warehouse of entangled ropes, ice axes, crampons, harnesses hanging from everywhere. A world I somehow feel more comfortable in.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I try to look less disgusting with all these full nausea bags around me, but they actually don’t seem to look down on me for that. Two of them happen to be doctors! And one of them happens to have the same kind of headache. In memory of this new British-Transsylvanian mountaineering friendship we share a couple of Aspirins. Later on a French climber lady tells us that this was the best thing we could have taken for altitude disease. She takes one a day each day she spends above a certain height and never has problems ever since she discovered this. Again I learned something. The time the remedy takes for healing me is quite long however. Basically the whole night! I use this time for praying for protection. Later on I will come to know that this was a very wise thing, I really needed what I asked for.<br/></span></p>
<p class="c10"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">DAY 1</span><br/></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Next morning is the morning of a slow trek down to the other valley and also of the quest of a Master. I hope you don’t mind the metaphor, I just mean that it took me some time to find the mountain guide I was allotted to. We look at each other. I know at first sight that he is an old mountain bear, familiar with every little crack and every big gully labyrinth of the glacier, absolutely at ease at handling any equipment and danger situation should it come to a rescue operation. And he probably knows of me immediately that I work in an office, have overweight problems and am not very confident when it is a matter of physical skills. He probably also feels how badly I want yet to do this trip. To have the taste of the unknown. When I put the harness in, with a strong pull he tests whether I adjusted the clips well, closed the screw karabiner properly etc. He is satisfied and that gives me some confidence. But at the end, when we clip ourselves onto the rope, he makes the knot himself to be sure that I am safe. Now I (and the other rope-mates) have become his responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The strongest of the team is a 27 year old Swiss boy; none would contest his good endurance and strength. He is at the end of the rope. The weakest is actually me, so I am just next after the leader, that is: second to the guide. We keep a distance from each other, so that the rope is tight (or almost) for in case of a fall, closeness would mean that more than one person is pulled down by the bodyweight of the falling companion. And we start this comfortable descent into the very body and heart of the glacier. Silence invades, envelopes everything and everyone. For hours and hours we only speak when someone gets into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">From the altitude of 3400 meters we will descend to 2600 and then climb up a laddered wall (an easy "via ferrata") back to 2800 to sleep there in a hut. But this is just the altitude difference. The distance we have to cover is, of course, much longer and it definitely is much less safer than merely walking five hours. Below our feet is a 900 meter deep ice cube, cut and ploughed a million times by the natural erosion, rich in cuts and abrasions and furrows and cracks and crevasses and holes and precipices and gullies and what not! And all these are covered with snow or are abridged by snow-plates to the point of being totally masked.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Sometimes one doesn’t walk on the glacier, but on a layer of thickened consistent snow with a hollow space under it! And sometimes these snow-bridges don’t resist man’s bodyweight. These are the moments when the soil (well, the snow carpet beneath) suddenly opens below your feet and in a second you find yourself hanging on a rope above a black emptiness of an unknown depth (anything from nine to almost nine hundred ! meters). In lucky cases one of your feet or at least your hands, arms still have something solid to hold onto, your upper body may be bent or leaning on snow with your lower body in the absolute nothing, but even then it is quite a manoeuvre to liberate yourself from the pull of dark depth and eventually of this porridge-like snow rim that may prevent your thigh from being lifted above the ground (quasi the other shore of the snow-crevasse).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">It is hard to imagine if you haven’t experienced it yet, and I admit, to me it was a scary feeling. I just wonder how I could be so rational when it first happened. At an unfortunate step I found myself doubled with my stomach and two arms hugging the snow where fifteen seconds ago the guide had stepped, while one of my feet lost all ground, I could only see some dark distance below it. My other leg was entangled in the wet snow wall of the crevasse. In seconds interfered some sober mind that wasn’t probably the real mind: 'don’t look down into the bottom, do it fast, but do it gingerly'. It still took me some time to cautiously overcome the situation without further ruining my snow bridge (the part of it that didn’t break and fall down). It is like trying to climb up a hopper or a funnel that is turned upside down, or like coming up from a bottle through its tightening neck. And on top of this, this neck is so fragile, so vulnerable. A wrong movement would send my only (seemingly solid) support down into the hole and then I would loose all ground, all fixed spot, testing what it feels like to be a spider with only the rope holding my weight. So, without ruining the place where one has to step next, one gently forces oneself to the surface, sometimes even the people closest in the rope can give him a pull and one is up again. Until the next fall</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>J</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At the second bad luck event, I was grateful to the rope, to the guide who held it and I fully agreed with my much more experienced climber friend D, who had told me well beforehand 'a glacier is always life-threatening if you cross it on your own'. The parallel is also very clear: without a master one should definitely not venture into the advanced mountaineering fields of spiritual life, unless one is tempting suicide. Without strong people around you in the same rope, falling into a crevasse like this can very easily turn into a fatal experience right from the beginning. And this is yet nothing compared to the higher glaciers of our earth, the ice-falls of the Himalayas where you don’t simply walk ON TOP of these fragile ice and snow bridges and features, but also, you are bound to risk going INTO and BELOW and BETWEEN them, sometimes on all fours, sometimes in vertical, sometimes balancing through precariously placed metal ladders spanning over giant gaps etc. But let mstay with my limited experience and capacities for the moment.<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c7"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">‘Never ever do that’</span></span></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">After a couple of hours of cautiously trudging in the snow and still before I had the first experience of loosing the ground beneath my feet we stopped for a few minutes. We got a little closer together to have a chocolate, an apple, whatever. At this point I decide to go near the only other girl in our group of eight adventurers. Since I don't want to entangle the rope I just unclip myself, put the rope down and walk towards her. In seconds I hear the reproaching voice of the guide: 'What are you doing? Where do you think you are?'</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Uh, he is right, too right. I am on a glacier. I am above hollow spaces that - at places- only some fragile snow plates separate from me. And right now I am not even secured!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The two and half meters back to my knot in the rope have become a much longer distance. I make my way back sweating while the others look on, but - should I fall below- cannot help. A great lesson: never unclip yourself of the rope. You cannot leave just like that, or you expose yourself to danger.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">During the next hour I come to appreciate this rope (and the boundedness it means) three times, for I experience three (thank God, minor) falls.</span></p>
<span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">This night I know that I will have nightmares. If not nightmares than just vague movie clips right before falling asleep and all of them will end up with some black deep hole suddenly opening below my weight. No, I don't want that, anything but to revive these real pictures again. At this point my joy knows no bounds when I find my mp3-player in one of the pockets of the rucksack. How much I hesitated whether I should carry this little extra weight or leave it at home. Finally I squeezed it in the pocket "just in case". Nothing better can happen to me now. My Master's voice always helped me until now, whenever I was in a bad mood, low consciousness, prone to fear or tantrums. It does help this time also. Before the battery goes down due to the cold, I can listen to two poems at least. And my anxiety is gone along with those creepy pictures and scary feeling. His voice chases away my fear and my unpleasant memories of the day. I plunge in a healthy slumber for at least three hours. Then comes the predecessor of sunrise, the first dark purple ray of light cutting the Zulu night away from the snow-covered ridge above the hut. And it is no longer snowing. We might have a great day today.</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Four forty</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. The first climbers put their equipment on and set off. I stare at them, inwardly wish them safe tryouts and yearn to be like them one day: brave, daring, easy-hearted while pacing off in the dark daybreak.</span>

	“There are no limits to our capacities because we have the Infinite Divine within us”- Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>
	Climbing is not a sport that everyone in the world takes up - but for the few that do, the rewards are rich.</p>
<p>
	Climbers will often speak of the confidence and determination gained from their efforts, the thrill of making a summit, the camaraderie born of team effort and shared experience amongst those who accept the challenge. Climbers often talk of the exhilaration that comes as a result of the mountain environment - a spiritual experience that can often only be felt and rarely adequately described.</p>
<p>
	Among the members of the global Sri Chinmoy Centre, there are some hardy souls that love to climb - an activity that their spiritual teacher, Sri Chinmoy, encourages them to pursue. The qualities that one needs for climbing - such as fitness, concentration, determination, awareness and wisdom - are very much on a parallel with qualities needed for progress to be made in the spiritual life.</p>
<p>
	The members of our International Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team are trying to transcend their own “limits” in many ways and mountain climbing is one of them. They have done many climbs in different parts of the world, reaching high in North and South America, in the Himalayas, Alps…<br />
	<br />
	This is their contribution in our effort to inspire you to reach deeper within your self and transcend your own&nbsp;capacities.</p>

<p class="documentDescription">The English Channel Swim crossings never come easy for Karteek...</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>In his quest to swim across The English Channel 7 times, Karteek Clarke from Edinburgh braved 16 hours, 13 minutes in a "washing machine" condition day July 28th.</p>
<p>He reports that the swim started well and thought they were on course for a fast time. But lo and behold, The Channel decided otherwise and kicked in a whale of a wind and the tide struck. But it was Karteek she was dealing to and he powered on. The next blow came when he narrowly missed The Cape and found it would be another 5 1/4 hours to finally finish! Other reports have come in telling of the schools of beautiful jellyfish out to greet the crossing swimmers. Karteek promises his own detailed report for us soon. </p>
<p>Congratulations! Only one more to go till seven!!</p>
<p>Coming soon on the next tide, watch for Henrik, Jozef, and Vijaya.</p>

			<h2>The Channel vs. Hawaii Ironman</h2>

            <p class="documentDescription">Which is the harder task? Well, in my opinion....</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>A few days ago, Venu asked me which is harder - The Hawaii Ironman Triathlon or swimming The English Channel.</p>
<p>For me there is no question: The English Channel is the hardest. In the Ironman, there are 3 different sports and therefore 3 changes of work or muscle groups. Lots of things to look at to distract you in the process. And if you are tired, you can stop to rest awhile or slow down.</p>
<p>Swimming The English Channel, however, gives the swimmer only a few things to occupy the mind. If you slow down or stop, well, you freeze in the cold water! I cannot imagine how one does this big swim without meditation or something very close to it!<br/>
<br/>
For me, swimming is pure meditation. It is my fastest way to a meditative consciousness when I am "on my own." I wish everyone could experience this kind of peaceful swimming. But I have learned that everyone has their own way - art, music, writing, running... so many different avenues!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck swimmers and triathletes!<br/>

			<h2>The Swimming New Year!</h2> 
		 	            	<div class="page-header-submitted clearfix">

        </div>	
         
                <div class="page-body">
            <p class="documentDescription">Unless you live "down under" the Summer is over and the 2004 open water season has ended. Time to plan some swimming New Year Resolutions for 2005!</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p class="c3">       2004 was a good year of swimming and swim spectating.</p>
<p class="c3"><strong>Great Water Inspiration All Around!</strong> </p>
<p class="c3">         Lots of new World Records at country's Olympic Trials.            Thrilling record swims at the Athens Olympics.</p>
<p class="c3">Fast overall times and the oldest male record set in The English Channel. The Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team Swimmers added 2 more English Channel crossings to make an outstanding total of 33 crossings to date! </p>
<p class="c3">And, another successful Zurich Lake Int'l. Marathon Swim event  hosted by the Switzerland Centres.  </p>
<p class="c4"> </p>
<p class="c4">Now is the time for you to use some of that inspiration and consider your swim plans for next season. 2005 sounds far away, but really, it isn't! Your big event will be a far happier experience if you lay down a good foundation of training and fund-raising during this Fall and Winter.</p>
<p class="c4">Very soon our training page on this site will carry long distance pool workouts that you can try out to help build your swim fitness foundation. These are wokouts I gave over the last year for the master's swim team I coach in San Francisco. I find it much easier to do these workouts in a group or with another swimmer or two. But if you have discipline and dedication, you can also swim them on your own.</p>
<p class="c4">One of the first things you must do is find out what your "base interval time" is now. Try this short set below to find your base interval time. You will use this time in almost every workout. It is also a great way to see your progress as you get in better shape with your training.</p>
<p class="c4"><strong><u>WARM-UP</u></strong></p>
<p class="c4">200 easy freestyle / 200 easy kick with fins / 200 long glide freestyle (200 is yards or metres distance)</p>
<p class="c4"><strong><u>BASE INTERVAL TEST SET</u></strong></p>
<p class="c4"><strong>10 X repeat 100 (yards or metres) Freestyle</strong>  Good strong steady but moderate effort. You should be able to hold the same time on every repeat with no more than 5-10 seconds rest.</p>
<p class="c4">The send-off time is your base interval.</p>
<p class="c4">Example:</p>
<p class="c4">You swam 100 yards in a time of 1 minute and 20 seconds. Rest for 10 seconds and leave for the second 100 repeat when the clock reads 1 minute and 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="c4">If you can follow this exact sequence for 10 repeats, your base interval will be 1:30. If you miss a few of the repeats by about 5 seconds or it was tough holding the time at 1:20 with 5 or 10 seconds rest, your base should probably be 1:35 or maybe even 1:40.</p>
<p class="c4">Test the set out at your own speed and find your own base interval. It may be 1:45 or 2 minutes. Be honest and start easier than harder. You can later adjust your base interval if you get faster. Remember that you are building a base and alot of your early swimming will be aerobic training.</p>
<p class="c3"><strong> Be sure to cool down with a few easy laps after your workout!</strong></p>
<p class="c4">Watch for the swimming workouts coming soon on the training page!</p>
<p class="c4"> </p>

<div class="documentBody">
<p class="c3">Important News from this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Queen of The Channel, Alison Streeter</b> continues her vow to swim an English Channel crossing for each year of her life. Now at number 43 after a successful cross on July 24th!</li>
<li>Mike Read swam his 33rd crossing July 27th and is now the <b>King of The Channel</b>, a title he has shared off and on again with Britain's Kevin Murphy.  </li>
<li>A new "must have book" for open water swimmers by The Queen of The Seas, <b>Lynne Cox</b>, has finally been published. <i><b>Swimming to Antarctica</b></i>. Get it. You won't be sorry. It is unparalled and even your non-swimming friends will love it!<b>Christof Wandratsch</b> announces he will attempt to break The English Channel crossing record again this year. He lists a set of dates September 4-10 as his target tide. In 2002, Wandratsch narrowly missed the 20 year old record with a time of 7 hours 19 minutes and 48 seconds. That was just two minutes short of the world record, set in 1994 by American Chad Hundeby.</li>
<li><b>The Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team Swimmers</b> now have 32 English Channel crossings on their record. Karteek Clarke added #32 on July 28th.</li>
<li>Channel Swimmers from Ireland... yes and alot of them! 4 relays of <b>Irish swimmers</b> have crossed The Channel already this 2004 season!  </li>
<li>Many tributes are being offered this year to <b>Gertrude Ederle</b>, the first woman to swim The English Channel. Miss Ederle passed late last year at age 98. August 6, 1926 at the age of 20, she crossed The Channel in the most incredible feat for a woman yet. The time of 14 hours, 31 minutes was the fastest yet, for any man also. A 13.5 million dollar park project which includes <b>The Ederle Terrace</b> has been opened in the SCMT Swimmer's home base of Queens, New York. </li>
</ul>
<p>That is a bit of catch-up in the world of English Channel swim news this year. I'll keep you posted!</p>
<p>Wishing you all warm and peaceful waters... Ahelee.<br/>

<div class="documentBody">
<p>Congratulations to each of you!</p>
<p>I broke out of the fog and traveled to Southern California. The beautiful sunny weather and a stunning ocean swim in Santa Barbara that I got in, really brought back the memories of all the great Channel training from a few years ago. But alas, here I am, back in the fog and gray of San Francisco. This however, is the place where "real" Channel Swim Training happens every day of the year.</p>
<p>A note came the other day from South End Rowing Club president, Bill Wygant, that their <a href="http://www.south-end.org/invitational/">Alcatraz Invitational</a> this Fall is nearly sold out. Lynne Cox will be the master of ceremonies. And we hope to have all the swimmers over to our Ananda Fuara Restaurant for food and gab that weekend too! Would love to see any of you near by there! Saturday, October 2nd. Come for fun, even of you don't swim. September/October is by far the most beautiful time of the year in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Ali and friends, thank you for the updates on everyone! I don't think I will ever get over HOW SENSATIONAL it is too see the progress reports of the crossing swimmers!</p>
<p>Does someone know where these girls doing the 3-way are from?</p>
<p>Hope the weather holds out for all of you coming up to swim now! We'll be watching from the around the world for updates!<br/>
Good Luck!</p>

			<h2>Thinking or Dreaming of Swimming The English Channel?</h2> 
		 	            	<div class="page-header-submitted clearfix">

            <p class="documentDescription">Don't Dream - JUMP!!</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>To anyone who reads this, who may have any tiny drop of interest in swimming the English Channel...</p>
<p>When I first met Sri Chinmoy, I was quite astounded by the stories I read of his students who had swum The English Channel. You must understand that I come from a very competitive swimming and triathlon sports background. And make that SPRINT distance events! Well, yes, I did eventually get into the Ironman Triathlon after many years of sprint racing. But relative to The Channel, even that swim is a sprint! The Channel was far beyond my imagination, so I thought!</p>
<p>In my journey to swim The English Channel, these SCMT swimmers were often my inspiration.</p>
<p>This is the reason.</p>
<p>Many of them had little or no competitive swim training background at all. So I desperately made them talk to me about just how they managed to swim across The English Channel! Hopefully, we will have all their stories on our website -soon! They helped me much more than they know.</p>
<p>If you enjoy swimming. If you like to train. If you like to eat! If you have some swimming background. If you find yourself constantly drawn to the challenge of swimming across this beautiful and powerful body of water, then I challenge you to try to begin your training and plans.</p>
<p>My very good friend, Vasanti from Germany, trained for (alot) less than 1 year before her crossing. Most know of her amazing determination and faith. A group of boys from New York, Adhiratha, Anugata, Dhruva, Sunil and many more took on the challenge with far less swimming background than most recreational lap swimmers. They found not only success, but some very fast times! We watch Karteek every year face difficult swims with a new regiment of training and focus. And then there is Vedika who has swum 22 and 23 hours to complete her crossing!</p>
<p>When Sri Chinmoy asked me to swim The English Channel, I was so surprised. I thought he was joking with me. But no, there were specific instructions and I tried to follow them. Looking back, I still can not believe it was me climbing the rocks on the shore of France. It was an experience beyond anything I had in all my life. And it changed my life. It is so hard to explain. Better you should experience it yourself!</p>
<p>My EC training team was Sri Chinmoy, Vasudha, and myself. Bigalita was my cheerleader. Dhavala, Shayamala, and Bhagirathi were my added as my Channel Crew. There were lots and lots of obstacles along the way. The training was hard and yes, I did get fat! But we all had a victory that would not have been possible without one of the team.</p>
<p><strong>So You Dear Swimmer!</strong></p>
<p>Build a team. Make a plan and have some fun. The journey to The English Channel crossing is just about the best part!</p>
<p>Several people have sent messages that I should swim The Channel again. I feel it is time to look for new challenges.  But I am comitted to helping any of you that need help. I will post all the information that I can to our Channel Swimmers website. </p>
<p>Next year is the 20th Anniversary of our team's first English Channel crossings by Vasanti and Adhiratha.</p>
<p>(Have I mentioned that already?)</p>
<p>Somehow I have the thought that we should send 20 SCMT swimmers to cross The Channel next year. If that team included a relay of girls and a relay of boys, only 8 more would be required to attempt their solo swims. Ok... we could add anther relay and have 2 solos, but I know many more will be inspired to solo swim!</p>
<p> So, what do you say swimmers?<br/>
<i>Don't worry... I was surprised and challenged when I heard it first too!!</i></p>
<p>San Francisco is an EXCELLENT place to train for The Channel. The water is very similar in temperature and it is easy access to Aquatic Park where crazy open water swimmers swim all year long. AND Ananda Fuara can't be beat for gaining that extra "Channel Fat"! Venu's neatloaf is magical Channel Swimmer fuel...</p>
<p>And we need an Australian or two! Such a swimming powerhouse country! They should be represented.</p>
<p>My roommate, Jayashri, has a deposit in and is willing to build a team of girls for a relay. Igor (Ukraine), I think you are committing to a swim. Vasanti is considering an "anniversary swim crossing". Who else?<br/>
Karteek will be going for his 7th crossing and Vedika too.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your questions and building a team for 2005!</p>
<p>_<br/>
Ahelee<br/>
