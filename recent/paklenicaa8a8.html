<meta name="description" content="So far I have had two memorable visits to the Croatian climbing Mecca of Paklenica. I went there for the first time in May last year with Sasko, a friend of mine from the Macedonian Climbing Association, and I was very surprised and inspired by the concentrated climbing vibration and atmosphere that exists in this famous National Park. Having had a long ride there by car we arrived without sleep early in the morning, eager to see where the big routes are. There was not a soul to be seen, but we knew that during the day it would be full, judging by the cars from all over Europe in the nearby town of Starigrad and the number of tents we saw in the local car-camps.    -NW Face Anica Kuk                    As we had guessed, at around 7-8 am climbers were getting an early start on the big routes of Anica Kuk, which rises up around 350 meters in its middle section. We pitched our tent in one of the camps (in the only remaining place left) and we bought the local guidebook and started looking up at the many different routes from the parking lot. There were so many climbers; I had the impression that when I was up there I would turn and have a look around and always find someone climbing beside me. Even small children in groups of 5-6 were making their first climbing moves under their instructor&#039;s eye. It was just climbing, climbing and climbing... Since both of us are interested in climbing long routes we  immediately started looking at the routes of Anica Kuk&#039;s North-West Face. That day we decided to go on a route that was a &quot;must&quot; in the guidebook - Mosoraski. The guidebook told us that this 350 metre climb was the best introduction for the rock and for the height as it was one of the longest climbs but not very hard. Luckily, there were not many parties in front of us, so following only a party of two we were enjoying the view of the whole area. It is something that I could never describe. The rock was fairly solid (in comparison to the limestone that we have in Macedonia) and only the friction moves were a little strange at the beginning (at first it was like there was no friction) but I sort of got used to it after a while. The crux of the route is rated V; it was OK, an easy V. It is situated in the last rope-length and it was a little exposed at that height but with a few moves we were out of it and enjoying the scene of the setting sun over the Adriatic. The next day we went on the North Face of the same area where the shorter routes are located. The route that we wanted to climb was named Ljubljanski, it is 250 meters long and being a Slovenian route (like most of the routes there) we expected something more serious then the day before. The crux was rated VI+ and it was in the V/VI region for most of the time. It was a demanding route and it was a very fulfilling feeling when we finished it. When we came down it was still around noon - still time to to do another one so we picked up the short route called Zgreseni in the Stub area. This is a route that goes diagonally up to the right following a crack with a crux of VI- and it is about 150 meters long. The crux is with a bigger distance between the bolts - it is a strange move that demands hand strength and I realized that you just have to move through it quickly instead of trying to find some easier way out of the problem using your mind. This route is called Zgreseni which means Mistaken - it was named because a party that wanted to do a repeat climb of the real route (that is few meters on the left and also follows a crack but goes much higher), but they made a wrong choice of a crack and thus ended up being the first party to climb this route. At the end of it we went to a place where we could watch the routes on the NW wall; we wanted to go on the Velebiteski route the next day. It is also a famous one - but hard. Sustained difficulties with a crux of VII- on a 350m high route - the description inspired us the moment when we read it. The next morning when we arrived there was a group of 4 Czech climbers about 5 meters to the right from our route. When we opened the guide book and started talking about the route they realized that they were not on the route they wanted to be. So the leading climber came down and asked if they could go ahead  in front of us. We agreed, thinking they would move quickly. They started climbing; they had one climber (the best one among them) leading the route, the second climber following up securing both the first one who would continue and the third one who was starting up towards him - an incredibly slow method. This was something I&#039;ve never seen before. At any one time this group was taking 3 pitches of the route. Sasko and I looked at each other and couldn&#039;t believe it; we decided we had to pass this Czech train. The Czechs accepted this readily enough, realizing that otherwise no-one would be able to climb that route that day. So climbing on a difficult terrain and almost moving together with climbers, we were ahead of them after the fifth or sixth pitch. The route is situated almost in the middle of the big wall and it is very exposed, especially on the slabs on the upper half. Very hard and strenuous. The moves were very demanding and we were happy to be out of it. However, with all the hard work done, I lost my concentration for a second as I was releasing the rope out of the belay device - I dropped the device instead of the rope and I could only watch as it hit the wall below me a few times and disappeared. When I came to my partner I told him I had two pieces of news: some good news and some bad news. The good news: we had passed the hardest pitches in the route and we had only 2-3 pitches of III/IV grade ahead. The bad news: I lost the belay-device. To be honest, it is not something that bad (only if you have to rappel down - but even then) because you can belay by other means; I just wanted to share the joke because we had been having a good climb and I was feeling really satisfied at that moment. Once out of the route, we remained on the top for a while, partaking of the water and fruit that we had brought in our backpacks. The next day was our last day there and we wanted to climb something long again (but easy) so we went on the first route that was made on this wall - a route called Brahmov. This route is fairly easy with only one pitch that is with a crux of VI- (or IV with A1) but long about 300 meters. When we came to the stance at the beginning of that hard pitch which is somewhere in the middle after a longer traverse to it we thought that we had the right line to follow, but what hung us was something that didn&#039;t look VI-. Sasko suggested that maybe we had to go a little more to the right but there were no pitons or bolts over there so we stayed there; it was hard and we had a problem moving through it even using the IV, A1 variation. When we were out of this pitch we saw that it was from the other route and we indeed had to move more to the right, but again we were on easy ground so it was fine. On the top we savoured the mountaintop view of the Adriatic for the last time and went down. When we came down we looked in the guidebook and we sow that that pitch was from (I don&#039;t remember the name) another route, which was 2 grades harder. We had a good laugh about this and we started getting ready for home. Second time I went there with my dear friends Mukul from Israel, Dusan from Slovakia and Ekalabhya from Macedonia (with whom I climbed on Frendo few days before). It was October and we met in Vienna, Austria on the two concerts that Sri Chinmoy gave there on his European tour 2004. Sri Chinmoy that year also gave concerts in Prague and Budapest. These concerts certainly refilled our batteries after the arduous climb in the Alps. Sri Chinmoy played numerous instruments the sound of which still echo inside me even now as I am writing this text a few months later. Inspiring moments like these awaken a sense of fulfillment in my heart and keep me in a spiritual mood that is as hard to explain as it is hard to explain why we climb. I always remember this poem by Sri Chinmoy:  NO DOUBT CAN TORTURE YOU  If your mind can imagine  And if your heart can feel  That at the end of your heavenward jorney  God will grant you  His stupendous Satisfaction-Smile,  Then no fear, no doubt can torture you  Or prevent you from completing  The seemingly long and arduous climb. This was first time that this group had gone climbing together on some long routes so we did not experiment much with new routes - we tried the easy (longer) route called Nosorog, but then we did Mosoroski and Zgreseni which I knew from my previous visit. The rest of the time we had a lot of sport climbing which was Dusan&#039;s specialty where he was trying some hard moves also. Paklenica is a place where you can climb in whatever condition you are in because of the wide choice of routes - long and short routes, a wide range of technical difficulties, most of the routes are bolted, and it&#039;s in a scenic area so close to the sea... It is a place that I would certainly recommend for rest after some hard climbing on alpine-style faces - in the pleasant atmosphere I easily forgot the promise I gave myself in the Alps, hanging on some wall hundreds of metres over ground, that I would never do something this crazy again.....   Enthusiasm and cheerfulness   Are the   Inner war-winners                                   -Sri Chinmoy" />

<p><tt><span class="c3">So far I have had two memorable visits to the Croatian climbing Mecca</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>of</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Paklenica. I went there for the first time in May last year with</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>Sasko, a friend of mine from the Macedonian Climbing Association, and</tt> <tt>I was very surprised and inspired by the concentrated climbing</tt> <tt>vibration and atmosphere that exists in this famous National Park.</tt> <tt>Having had a long ride there by car we arrived without sleep early in</tt> <tt>the morning, eager to see where the big routes are. There was not a s</tt><tt>oul to be seen, but we knew that during the day it would be full,</tt> <tt>judging by the cars from all over Europe in the nearby town of</tt> <tt>Starigrad and the number of tents we saw in the local car-camps.</tt><br/></span></p>
<div class="c7"><span class="c4"><img class="c5" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/anica" height="349" width="275"/>   <img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/dusan" height="237" width="202"/></span></div>

<p><span class="c4"><span class="c8">-NW Face Anica Kuk</span>                   </span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>As we had guessed, at around 7-8 am climbers were getting an early</tt> <tt>start on</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the big routes of Anica Kuk, which rises up around 350 meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">in its</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">middle section. We pitched our tent</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">one of the camps (in the only</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">remaining place left) and we bought the local guidebook</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>and started looking up at the many different routes from the parking</tt> <tt>lot. There were so many climbers; I had the impression that when I was</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">up there I would turn and have a look around and always find someone</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing beside me. Even small children in groups of 5-6 were making</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">their first climbing moves under their instructor's eye. It was just</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing, climbing and climbing...</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Since both of us are interested in climbing long routes we </tt> <tt>immediately started looking at the routes of Anica Kuk's North-West</tt> <tt>Face. That day we decided to go on a route that was a "must" in the</tt> <tt>guidebook - Mosoraski. The guidebook told us that this 350 metre climb</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">was the best introduction for the rock and for the height as it was one</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of the longest climbs but not very hard. Luckily, there were not many</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">parties in front of us, so following only a party of two we were</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">enjoying the view of the whole area. It is something that I could never</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">describe.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>The rock was fairly solid (in comparison to the limestone</tt> <tt>that we have in Macedonia) and only the friction moves were a little</tt> <tt>strange at the beginning (at first it was like there was no friction)</tt> <tt>but I sort of got used to it after a while.</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">The crux of the route is rated V; it was OK, an easy V. It is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">situated in the last rope-length and it was a little exposed at that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">height but with a few moves we were out of it and enjoying the scene of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the setting sun over the Adriatic.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>The next day we went on the North Face of the same area where the</tt> <tt>shorter routes are located. The route that we wanted to climb was named</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Ljubljanski, it is 250 meters long and being a Slovenian route (like</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">most of the routes there) we expected something more serious then the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day before. The crux was rated VI+ and it was in the V/VI region for</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">most of the time. It was a demanding route and it was a very fulfilling</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">feeling when we finished it. When we came down it was still around noon</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">- still time to to do another one so we picked up the short route</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">called Zgreseni in the Stub area. This is a route that goes diagonally</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">up to the right following a crack with a crux of VI- and it is about</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">150 meters long. The crux is with a bigger distance between the bolts -</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">it is a strange move that demands hand strength and I realized</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that you just have to move through it quickly instead of trying to find</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">some easier way out of the problem using your mind. This route is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">called Zgreseni which means Mistaken - it was named because a party</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that wanted to do a repeat climb of the real route (that is few meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the left and also follows a crack but goes much higher), but they</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made a wrong</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">choice of a crack and thus ended up being the first party to climb this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>At the end of it we went to a place where we could watch the routes on</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the NW wall; we wanted to go on the Velebiteski route the next day. It</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is also a famous one - but hard. Sustained difficulties with a crux of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">VII- on a 350m high route - the description inspired us the moment</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">when we read it. The next morning when we arrived there was a group of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">4 Czech climbers about 5 meters to the right from our route. When we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">opened the guide book and started talking about the route they realized</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that they were not on the route they wanted to be.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>So the leading climber came down and asked if they could go ahead</tt> <tt> in front of us. We agreed, thinking they would move quickly. They</tt> <tt>started climbing; they had one climber (the best one among them)</tt> <tt>leading the route, the second climber following up securing both the</tt> <tt>first one who would continue and the third one who was starting up</tt> <tt>towards him - an incredibly slow method. This was something I've never</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">seen before. At any one time this group was taking 3 pitches of the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route. Sasko and I looked at each other and couldn't believe it; we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">decided we had to pass this Czech train. The Czechs accepted this</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>readily enough, realizing that otherwise no-one would be able to climb</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">that route that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day. So climbing on a difficult terrain and almost moving together</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbers, we were ahead of them after the fifth or sixth pitch. The</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route is situated almost in the middle of the big wall and it is very</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">exposed, especially on the slabs on the upper half. Very hard and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">strenuous. The moves were very demanding and we were happy to be out</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of it.</span></tt></p>
<p class="c9"><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>However, with all the hard work done, I lost my concentration for a</tt> <tt>second</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">a</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">s I was releasing the rope out of the belay device - I dropped</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the device instead of the rope and I could only watch as it hit the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">wall below me a few times and disappeared. When I came to my partner I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">told him I had two pieces of news: some good news and some bad news.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">The good news: we had passed the hardest pitches in the route and we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">had only 2-3 pitches of III/IV grade ahead. The bad news: I lost</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the belay-device. To be honest, it is not something that bad (only if</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">you have to rappel down - but even then) because you can belay by other</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">means; I just wanted to share the joke because we had been having a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">good climb and I was feeling really satisfied at that moment. Once out</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of the route, we remained on the top for a while, partaking of the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">water and fruit that we had brought in our backpacks.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/></span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>The next day was our last day there and we wanted to climb something</tt> <tt>long again (but easy) so we went on the first route that was made on</tt> <tt>this wall - a route called Brahmov. This route is fairly easy with</tt> <tt>only one pitch that is with a crux of VI- (or IV with A1) but long</tt> <tt>about 300 meters. When we came to the stance at the beginning of that</tt> <tt>hard pitch which is somewhere in the middle after a longer traverse to</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">it we thought that we had the right line to follow, but what hung</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>us was something that didn't look VI-. Sasko suggested that maybe we</tt> <tt>had to go a little more to the right but there were no pitons or bolts</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">over there so we stayed there; it was hard and we had a problem moving</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through it even using the IV, A1 variation. When we were out of this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitch we saw that it was from the other route and we indeed had to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">move</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">more to the right, but again we were on easy ground so it was fine. On</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the top we savoured the mountaintop view of the Adriatic for the last</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">time and went down. When we came down we looked in the guidebook and we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sow that that pitch was from (I don't remember the name) another route,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which was 2 grades harder. We had a good laugh about this and we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">started</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">getting ready for home.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Second time I went there with my dear friends Mukul from Israel, Dusan</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">from Slovakia and Ekalabhya from Macedonia (with whom I climbed on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3"><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/frendo">Frendo</a> few days before). It was October and we met in Vienna, Austria</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the two concerts that <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> gave there on his European tour</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">2004. Sri Chinmoy that year also gave concerts in Prague and Budapest.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">These concerts certainly refilled our batteries after the arduous</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climb in the Alps. Sri Chinmoy played numerous instruments the sound of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which still echo inside me even now as I am writing this text a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">months later. Inspiring moments like these awaken a sense of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fulfillment in my heart and keep me in a spiritual mood that is as hard</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">to explain as it is hard to explain why we climb. I always remember</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">this poem by Sri Chinmoy:</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>

<span class="c11"><tt> The seemingly long and arduous climb.</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>This was first time that this group had gone climbing together on some</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">long routes so we did not experiment much with new routes - we tried</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the easy (longer) route called Nosorog, but then we did Mosoroski and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Zgreseni which I knew from my previous visit. The rest of the time we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">had a lot of sport climbing which was Dusan's specialty where he was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">trying some hard moves also.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Paklenica is a place where you can climb in whatever condition you are</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">in because of the wide choice of routes - long and short routes, a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">wide range of technical difficulties, most of the routes are bolted,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and it's in a scenic area so close to the sea... It is a place that I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">would certainly recommend for rest after some hard climbing on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">alpine-style faces - in the pleasant atmosphere I easily forgot the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">promise I gave myself in the Alps, hanging on some wall hundreds of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">metres over ground, that I would never do something this crazy</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">again.....</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>

<p>Question: If your goal is to run fifty miles per week, is it better to run seven miles a day or to vary the distance?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is always good to have easy and hard days. It is best to have two easy days and then one hard day. Even having alternate easy and hard days is not good enough. If you run fifteen miles one day, it is not good to run seven or ten miles the next day. Instead, on your hard days cover twenty or twenty-five miles or even a full marathon. Then take two easy days. In this way, you can cover seventy or eighty miles a week.</p>
<p>Only those who are very strong and who are seriously training for long-distance running should do more than seventy miles a week. They can run one hundred miles or one hundred twenty miles.</p>
<p>Question: How much importance should we give to physical exercise in comparison to our regular work?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: You are working very hard at your business, but you are thinking that that is the only work you have to do. You are giving one hundred per cent of your attention to your business and not even one per cent to your body. You have to feel that the body is also something necessary. So when you are here taking exercise or practising sports, you have to think that this is the only thing in your life. Otherwise, while you are practising sports you will still be thinking of your business. If you give importance to sport, you will get extra energy from it for your work.</p>
<p>Question: How do you feel about bicycle training to improve running?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: I did a great deal of bicycling when I lived in India in my youth. For at least two and a half hours every day I used to cycle as I did errands. It does not increase running speed at all, but something is better than nothing. Sometimes cycling can actually be a hindrance to running speed, because it develops special kinds of muscles which do not complement the speed muscles. Bicycling does help for endurance, but if you want to increase your running speed, then I don't advise it. You can cycle for endurance, or if you are injured and cannot run. For a little bit of stamina you can do it. But again, cycling stamina is totally different from running stamina. If one wants to become a good runner and maintain a five-minute pace, then cycling is not the answer. Quality road work is the answer.</p>
<p>Question: What is a good exercise to strengthen the legs when they get tired from standing all day?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If your legs get tired from standing all day, there are two exercises that are very good to strengthen them. One exercise develops the knee muscles. You sit on the floor with one leg straight, and the other leg bent with the knee up, both hands on your hips. Then you switch, bending the straight leg and straightening the bent leg. Then keep switching.</p>
<p>The other exercise is to do a deep knee bend on one leg, with the other leg out in front of you, and then stand up again, still keeping one leg in front of you. First you do it with a flat foot, then on your toe. If you can do it three or four times, your legs will have tremendous strength from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Question: Do people really need more sleep when they are training for athletics?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: For ordinary people, it is true. If they run a few miles, they need more sleep. But for spiritual people, especially advanced seekers, it is not necessary. By drawing down cosmic energy, in two minutes they can get the rest of two hours, three hours, four hours. It depends on how effectively you can draw in cosmic energy. But ordinary runners do have to sleep longer.</p>
<p>Question: What time of day is best to run?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It depends on the individual runner. Whenever the individual feels most physically fit, most vitally fit, most mentally fit and most psychically fit is the best time for that individual to run.</p>
<p>Running makes the body young. Striving makes the vital young. Smiling makes the mind young. Serving makes the heart young. Loving makes the soul young.</p>

<p>Question: I find that sometimes I go through a period of making very good progress in sport; and then after some time everything falls apart and my training goes downhill.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It happens to everyone. Life is not always smooth sailing; it goes up and down. The main thing is to get satisfaction. In sport, when you touch a peak you are very happy. When you are unable to reach your peak, you should not feel that it is your fault. It is not that you have deliberately injured yourself. You have not said to your body, "I fed you so many times; now I want to starve you." If you are deliberately enjoying your lack of speed or lack of enthusiasm, then you are to be blamed. But if circumstances have led you to this condition, please try to maintain your equanimity and peace of mind. Feel that you are going through a phase that may last for three or four weeks, but that eventually it will pass. Try to think of the summit which you reached two or three weeks earlier, and try to remember the joy that you felt. Then you will see that the joy you got from your previous achievements will carry you through, and very soon you will not only reach but transcend your previous height. You are not fooling yourself; you are only bringing happiness into your system, and this happiness is confidence. Again, confidence itself is happiness.</p>
<p>Try to feel that your problem is just a small obstacle, a hurdle that you will soon overcome. Then you will be able to diminish the frustration that you now feel. Once you diminish your frustration, again in a week or so you will be able to regain your capacity. But if you maintain or increase your frustration, then the problem will linger. It may go on for two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Question: Always when I become very interested in the physical and playing sports, I injure myself to the point where I have to stop completely. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: What actually happens in your case is that when you enter into the physical world - playing tennis or other things - you do not give value to the physical as such. You remain in the mind. A portion of your existence you throw into the game and another portion you keep totally in the mind-world. It is like cutting yourself in half. You are keeping your body on the first floor, but your consciousness is always on the upper floor, in the mind. If you can direct more of your mental energy into the physical when you play, this will not happen. You want to play; you want to win. But actually the concentration of the mind, the real concentration, is not in the physical itself. You know that you are playing tennis, but the concentration that the body needs from the mind is not there. There is a gap. The body without concentration from the mind is helpless. So, when you play, do not think of your mental work. Your mind may not be aware that it is thinking of the wrong thing, but it is one thing not to be aware of doing the wrong thing and another thing to concentrate consciously on the right thing. Inside you and all around you there are many beings. Because there is a gap between the mind's concentration and the physical activity, these beings can attack the physical. They need not actually be wrong forces, but they may create unfortunate experiences in life.</p>
<p>Question: How can running help me overcome my spiritual weaknesses and impurities?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: While you are running - especially when you are tired - you are much more conscious of your breathing. You are more aware of when you are inhaling and when you are exhaling. While running, when you inhale, you can consciously invoke divine energy to energize you. This divine energy energizes the willing reality in you and illumines the unlit reality in you so that you can become a perfect instrument of God. When you breathe in the divine energy, automatically it changes or transforms undivine forces into divine forces.</p>
<p>Each time you breathe in, if you can repeat just one time God's Name, or 'Supreme', or whatever divine name or form comes to mind, then that spiritual thought will increase your purity. Either it turns into purity within you or it grants purity to you. Then, when you breathe out, feel that a new eagerness and a new promise are going out from you to the Universal Consciousness. This new promise is nothing short of your sincere willingness and eagerness to become a good and perfect instrument of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Question: Should we run even when we are extremely tired?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: As a rule, when we are extremely tired it is not advisable to run, for it will not help us in any way. At that time, running will be nothing but fatigue and self-destruction, and it will leave in our mind a bitter taste. But sometimes, even when we are not extremely tired, we feel that we are. At that time we are not actually physically tired. We are only mentally tired or emotionally tired, but the mind convinces us that we are physically tired. Our human lethargy is so clever! It acts like a rogue, a perfect rogue, and we get tremendous joy by offering compassion to our body. We make all kinds of justifications for the body's lethargy and make ourselves feel that the body deserves rest.</p>
<p>So we have to be sincere to ourselves. If we really feel extremely tired, then we should not run. But we have to make sure that it is not our lethargic mind, our lethargic vital or our lethargic physical consciousness that is making us feel that we are extremely tired. This kind of tricky cleverness we have to conquer.</p>
<p>With our imagination-power we can challenge the tricky mind and win. We weaken ourselves by imagining that we are weak. Again, we can strengthen ourselves by imagining that we are strong. Our imagination often compels us to think we cannot do something or cannot say something. We often use imagination in a wrong direction. So instead of letting imagination take us backwards, we should use it to take us forward toward our goal.</p>
<p>Question: How do you run through inner pain?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Inner pain is a joke. Outer pain I believe in. Sometimes I can't place my foot on the ground without getting such pain! But inner pain, which comes from frustration, depression, jealousy and insecurity, is a joke. Inner pain should be discarded like a filthy rag! Outer pain you cannot so easily ignore, but inner pain must be discarded.</p>
<p>If you have inner pain, if you are jealous of someone or are in an undivine consciousness, then the outer running will actually help you. When you are running and perspiring, when you are struggling, at that time the inner pain goes away to some extent. Otherwise, if because you are depressed you don't go out to run, then you are just a fool. If you feel depressed while you are running, you can sing loudly and deliberately try to sing wrong notes. Then laugh at yourself. Some of my friends used to do this. They were good singers, but deliberately they would sing wrong notes while they were walking, and it would make them laugh. In that way they got rid of depression.</p>
<p>Question: If one is in generally good health, what would cause pain and aches in the body?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is one thing to have good health and another thing to deliberately maintain good health. Unless you are consciously keeping good health, at any moment you may be attacked by some forces. It is like having a large amount of money without knowing about it. If you are not conscious of it, you may easily lose it. If you are not conscious that you have a flower, you are likely to lose it. Anything that you have must have some place in your awareness. You may have good physical health, but perhaps in two months' time you have not thought of your body once, let alone tried to increase the strength of your legs or arms or to get some extra capacity.</p>
<p>Unless you touch something every day, it does not shine. Often I have told people to touch the furniture in their homes every day. As soon as you touch something, it gets new life. If you are aware of something, immediately it shines and gets a new luminosity. If you have good health, if you touch your health every day, it gets new life. By giving attention to something, you give new life to it.</p>
<p>Question: When I run I sometimes get a slight knee pain. Should I stop running at that time?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If you get just a slight pain in your knee, and if the pain is bearable, then you should continue running. At that time, feel that if you run a hundred metres more, the pain will go away. Then, after you have covered a hundred metres, feel that the pain will definitely stop if you run another hundred metres. If you do this five or six times, then most of the pain will go away. Even if some pain remains, the mind has already taken away your awareness from it. Your mind has forgotten about it. But if the pain is absolutely unbearable, what can you do? You simply have to surrender to it and stop running, at least for a while.</p>
<p>Question: How can we spiritually heal injuries?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is a matter of inner capacity. One kind of capacity is to heal the injury by bringing down peace and light from above. Another kind of capacity is to ignore the pain altogether. During your meditation, if all of a sudden you have intense aspiration, then you can bring down more light from above to cure your injury. But you have to do this consciously during your meditation. If during the day you casually say, "Oh, how I wish I didn't have any pain!" that will be useless. But while you are meditating, if you suddenly remember your pain, that is the time to pray and bring down more light.</p>
<p>Again, you can increase your capacity to tolerate pain. Now you have pain, let us say, but still you run; whereas if you had had the same kind of pain four years ago perhaps you would not have been able to run. Again, sometimes the pain is unbearable and it is absolutely impossible to run. Then what can you do? But if it is bearable, try to run according to your own capacity. At that time, don't think of how fast this person or that person is running. Just go according to your own capacity and remain cheerful. All the time think that you are running only against yourself. Again, if it is beyond your capacity to ignore the pain, in addition to praying and meditating, you can also go to the outer doctor. Light is also inside the doctor.</p>
<p>Question: Sometimes I feel pain in my foot, and I start worrying that if I keep running, I might get a stress fracture. This happens even if the pain is not that bad and I know that probably nothing will happen.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If it is unbearable, excruciating pain, then something serious might happen. But if there is just a tiny pain in your foot, this kind of fear is only false anxiety that is coming to your mind. If you are worried, you can take rest for a few days and see if the pain goes away. If it leaves in just a day or two, you will know that it was nothing serious. In this way you will become more confident that nothing will happen to your foot if you run.</p>
<p>So if the pain is not that serious, you do not have to worry. Your foot is not going to give out. It is only that fear has entered into your mind, and the mind has created false anxiety in you, a false alarm. You should not cherish these fears.</p>
<p>Morning running is purity's beauty. Evening running is simplicity's luminosity.</p>
<p>Don't take a late start. You may lose the race altogether. Keep your love-devotion-surrender Always on the alert. Then you cannot have a late start.</p>
<p>Run! You can easily challenge The pride of frightening distance.</p>
