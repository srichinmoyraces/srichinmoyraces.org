            <p class="documentDescription">Climbing in Macedonia</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p><span class="c3">Demir Kapija is an area in South-Central Macedonia about 120 km f</span><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">rom</span> <span class="c4"><tt>Skopje. A journey down the Skopje-Solun (Greece) highway or a railway</tt> <tt>connection will take you to the small settlement of the same name. The</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river Vardar separates the settlement of Demir Kapija from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>the big limestone rockface that rises up right from the left bank of</tt> <tt>the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river (making it hard to approach for climbing). The rock itself is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fragile - like any other limestone but also because it has not been</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed very often – frequent climbing “cleans up” the rock by pushing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down the loose rocks or even blocks, but here in Demir Kapija you could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">till find some dangerous patches, not because of the technical</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ifficulty but because of the potential danger of falling rocks. On the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ther hand, there still remains many possibilities for new routes. The</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span><tt><span class="c3">xisting routes are about 200-250 metres long</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">(d</span><span class="c3">epending where they</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">s</span><tt><span class="c3">tart) and in the IV-VI grading area.</span></tt></p>
<p><span class="c4"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/pristap1" height="167" width="252"/><span class="c4"><img class="c5" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/prist2" height="178" width="263"/></span></span></p>
<p><span class="c4">-The approaches</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>There are two ways to approach the routes - one by climbing up over to</tt></span></p>
<tt><span class="c3">the top and following a marked path that leads down over at times</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>difficult ground, or the second way over the highway.</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">There are two tunnels on the highway (about 500m after the junction for</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the town) and after passing the first one there is a little stream on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the right that goes towards the river where you can find a fixed steel</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cord so that you can traverse towards the routes. Usually we take the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">second approach because it is much faster and safer, but when the river</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is too high, we go around taking the other way. Getting down is easy.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">From the top there is a trail that leads down to the highway and from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>there into the town, but because it is not very well marked we</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">followed</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the ridge which then met up with the trail - from there on it was easy.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<tt>With Vesna</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">we</span> <span class="c3">have climbed 4 routes in this area - Tulumba,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Polzav, Slavkova and Blazeva. Vesna also has climbed the route Vlatceva</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with another climber. Tulumba and Polzav are two of the longest</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">existing routes. They start close to each other and have a common exit</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">– they share the last pitch. The grades in these routes are up to V but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">they are concentrated mainly in the first two pitches and in the last</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">one. The last third of the first pitch of Tulumba has one overhang</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which I passed using one little rock that was stuck in the wide crack</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cutting the upper part of the overhang in half. Usually when you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climb on</span> <span class="c3">harder rocks these moves give you real joy because of their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">unusual quality, but not here - climbing in such a fragile environment</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made me feel a little queasy about having to use this kind of handhold.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>But this was the only way, so first I put a sling around the rock for</tt> <tt>protection and after that I grabbed the rock, pulled on it, and moved</tt> <tt>on as quickly as I could. The first pitch on Polzav also finds you</tt> <tt>under a small overhang. I had to combine</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the handholds for my left hand on the overhang with the slab on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right where there were no good footholds at all - I had to climb using</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friction moves and</span> <span class="c3">reaching with my left hand as far as I could over</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the overhang. In both cases it was a real relief when I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">out of it. There were good belay stances above and I secured Vesna –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">she came out of these</span> <span class="c3">“problems” with a smile on her face since she</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could enjoy climbing concentrated only on the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and not worrying about holding on loose pieces of rock. The middle two</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches are easy III scrambling. The routes (like all the others here)</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">do not</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>have enough protection “in situ”, so climbing here means having your</tt> <tt>cams, nuts, slings and pitons prepared. The hardest moves in the routes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">are “clean” – the rock here is not (very) fragile so we were free to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">concentrate only on the moves. It is where the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">are</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">not as high that the terrain and the rock gets more fragile – but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that’s also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">part of the climbing… Vlatceva starts also close to these routes but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">has a more straight line and ends up also more to the right. When you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">look at the rock from the other side of the river the line of the route</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(few meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the right of Tulumba) is visible, following wide and narrow cracks</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">up the rockface…</span></tt>

<p>-Pozav(left) and Tulumba (right)</p>
<p><br/>
<tt>Slavkova is a shorter route that starts somewhere on the half of the</tt> <tt>rock, but much harder and here the crux reaches up to VI+ grade. The</tt> <tt>line of the route is far from “diretissima” - it just starts and goes</tt> <tt>up fearlessly towards the hardest technical</tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulties that are in its way. After some easy scrambling from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">river bank we got under the route which starts following a dehidre and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ends up few meters under the overhangs.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">The first belay stance is actually at the tree on the top of this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">dehidre after which the route goes up the slab and traverse to the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right. After this there is a line that will get you right under the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first overhang. Here the climbers feel (and are) very exposed. The hand</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and foot holds are such a position that we had to move almost lying</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">bodies horizontally in the air, turned sideways on the rock and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stretching over as far as we could to the right. The overhanging area</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is so big that when climbers move through the first overhang they can</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see the ground 200 meters under their legs … The first overhang can be</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed following a crack that moves diagonally to the right towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the second overhang. We made the second belay stance under the second</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhang because there was a drag on the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and I just couldn’t move through something this difficult pulling up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with my hand or body. The correct line goes straight up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the second overhand, but if you want to climb it free without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">using the pitons</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“in situ” for aid climbing but you can’t because it’s just not your</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day, you can go around to the right. We didn’t do this - but I must say</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that I was not successful passing this overhang from the first try</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(even second, third…:) There is enough protection “in situ” through the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhangs and in the area over and under them, but not enough in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first pitch where we used the crack that we followed that is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cam-friendly.</span></tt></p>

<p>-Slavkova route and climbers under the second overhang<br/>
<br/>
<tt>Blazeva is easy long route where the crux of grade VI is in the last</tt> <tt>7-8 meters where the route gets a little overhangy. For a route of</tt> <tt>around</tt> <tt><span class="c3">250</span> <span class="c3">metres this means pleasant long climb with beautiful views over the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridges that this route follows. The start is over an easy and wide</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">chimney (IV+/V) with lot of possibilities for putting cams and slings.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">But the rock here is more fragile and I had to be very careful how I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was climbing and what I was holding to because everything that would</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">brake would fall directly down on Vesna through the chimney where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">her belay stance was. After the first pitch there are two or three easy</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of easy II/III scrambling. Here we moved parallel and when we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">got at the point where the route gets more vertical we made the belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stance. From here on it gets a little harder but the rock was very</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hospitable for belay means. The last (very short) pitch has a grade VI</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and it starts on a big terrace where we enjoyed the views on the both</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sides of the canyon. The name “Demir Kapija” actually means “Iron</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Gate”. The canyon is like a gate from one valley to another so being on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a top or close gives you unique opportunity to see how the river curves</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the valleys on the both sides. The last pitch can be also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed by another</span> <span class="c3">variation that goes a little towards to the left</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">where we found big handholds and big cracks for cams (I could see a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">old and rusty pitons on my right that were from the harder variation).</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">These were the only “in situ” protection that we saw in this route.</span></tt></p>

<p><span class="c4">-The upper part of Blazeva</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>The Demir Kapija area is one of the hottest places in Macedonia (if</tt> <tt>not the hottest), so usually we don’t climb here during the summer</tt> <tt>period. The rock faces south so during the whole day</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">climbers are exposed under the sun and climbing on temperatures high</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">over 40 degrees Centigrade can be very exhausting… Still between the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tunnels, there is enough protection and shade and there are some short</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sport-climbing routes that can be done if it is really hot. There are</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>good places for putting up a tent near the small stream that also</tt> <tt>passes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">through</span> <span class="c3">here.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This was the place where, 7 years ago, I began climbing unprotected big</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">routes and I had to plan the route all by myself. I remember during</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first climb I was so concentrated</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on what I was doing while climbing that I only started noticing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">surroundings after reaching the upper half of the route. During</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first hour or two of climbing I couldn’t see anything else around</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only the gray rock, the forms on it, cracks, hand and footholds - I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">so concentrated climbing and protecting my climbing partner that it was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only after some time that I started seeing the valley. It was like</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being awakened from sleep - looking at the surrounding</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">environment, the river that was passing down there, the train, the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">town. It was like the picture was slowly getting filled piece by piece.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was amazed by this effortless concentration that climbing got me in…</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">In few books written by climbers I’ve read how they compare this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">activity with meditation. Meditation, like climbing, gives you a rare</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">opportunity to analyze</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">yourself and go deep and find your limitations and go over them. I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">remember a quote from one climber (unfortunately I can’t remember who</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that) who said that only when we will climb the mountains that are in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ourselves, the mountains of jealousy, fear, anxiety, only then we will</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">be on the highest mountain of the world…</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This is what <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> says about concentration and meditation:</tt></span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><tt>“…Concentration is the open secret of focusing all one’s attention on</tt> <tt>a particular object or person in order to enter into and have one’s</tt> <tt>identification with that object or person. The final stage of</tt> <tt>concentration is to discover and reveal the hidden ultimate Truth in</tt> <tt>the object of concentration. What concentration can do in our</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">day-to-day life is unimaginable. It most easily separates our heart’s</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Heaven from our mind’s hell so that we can live the constant delight</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and joy of Heaven and not in the perpetual worries, anxieties and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tortures of hell while we are on earth…”</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>“Meditation is man’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering. When</tt> <tt>men’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering meet together man becomes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">immortal in the inner world and God becomes fulfilled in the outer</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">world…It is only through meditation that we can get lasting peace,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">divine peace. If we can meditate soulfully in the morning and receive</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">peace for only one minute, that one minute of peace will permeate our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">whole day…We need meditation because we want to grow in Light and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fulfill ourselves in Light…”</span></tt></p>

            <p class="documentDescription">18/19 September 2004 - North Face of Aiguille du Midi by the route "Frendo Spur"</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<h3>Climbing up the North Face of Aiguille du Midi</h3>
<br/>
The many visitors that make the pilgrimage to the famous ski resort of Chamonix, France only have to look high up in the surrounding mountains to see the North Face of Aiguille du Midi. A short trip by lift gives them a unique opportunity to see every detail of all the major climbing routes, and sometimes one can even make out on the rockface the tiny spots of the climbers in action. During last year’s Alpine trip, I beheld the north face of Aiguille du Midi, and since then whoever asked me my plans for the next season was told emphatically that I want to go on Frendo, the imposing buttress that rises up almost straight through the middle of the big wall of Midi.<br/>
<br/>
The buttress is named after the Frendo-Rionda party, who did the first ascent by this route on 11 July 1941, followed twenty-three years later by the first winter ascent by the Stagni-Wohlschlag party on 21-22 January 1964. Our climb began on the seventeenth of September, 2004, when myself and my climbing partner, Ekalabhya, took what we needed for this climb up on to the glacier where we wanted to camp in order to have an early start the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/our route"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- The route</span><br/></div>
<br/>
I had spent all year reading as many descriptions as I could find  about the route, looking at some pictures, dreaming about it constantly - I thought that I knew everything there was to know. Maybe I did, but no amount of reading could have prepared me for that moment during our approach to the glacier when the true size of the task ahead dawned on me. 1200 meters of near-vertical rock face awaited us, starting up around 2600m and ending at the 3842 meters high summit. It was such an intimidating sight, and many times during our approach we had to avert our eyes as the the whole thing just became too mind-boggling. Everything that I thought I knew had just gone out the window. It was only when we set up our “base camp” and became occupied with the mundane jobs such as melting water that our anxiety went away and we could look at the route objectively, discussing matters such as where we could go faster and where we might have problems.<br/>
<br/>
We didn’t start particularly early the next morning and it wasnt untill 8:00am that we arrived under the rock itself, after a one-hour approach from our tent. The bergschrund (crevasse between the face and the glacier) was quite big and there was only one place were we could easily go on the rock. Up until now we had been quite calm and collected, but now we could see the true size of the rock features now that we were up close, and I was overwhelmed by the magnitude of it all. The north faces of the Alps are very cold during the whole day. At the beginning every touch on the rock was very uncomfortable but we were concentrating only on the climbing itself and after some time we forgot about the cold.<br/>
<br/>
We were climbing without any rest stops, trying to make our first bivouac place as high as possible, bearing in mind the last lift down from the mountain the next day left at 5:00pm. We didn’t have any problems finding our way on the rock - there was only one real route up, along the ridge, on either side of which there were only abysses and hold less slabs. From time to time we would find some leftovers from other climbing parties: cams, nuts, slings, a few pitons…<br/>
<br/>
The only problem was to get higher. But, not having acclimatized at all, we were moving increasingly more slowly the higher we ascended. Just before it got dark, we came under a vertical pillar that was raising four or five rope lengths up. We decided to sleep there,as we were unsure as to whether there was any better place to sleep further on. The sleep wasn't brilliant, to say the least. It got to the point when we would wake up because of the cold, wriggle around to warm up enough to go back to sleep, only to wake up again, and again...<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, the buttress rising up right in front of us did not seem half as scary as it was when we approached it from the glacier the day before. We knew where we should go, so we went. From that moment on the technical difficulty level of the climb was raised a notch or two and there was one or two times I really regretted not bringing my climbing shoes with me instead of the big plastic boots that I had. But once we started to encounter the parts with snow, I was more glad I brought my boots. We had been climbing for what seemed like ages and yet we still couldn’t see the start of the section where the rockface become covered completely in snow and ice. We changed the lead for what seemed like countless times. Finally we came to the snow arête where we could put on our crampons. From there we could see the station at the summit and we were confident that we would make it there before five o’clock. But it did not happen that way...<br/>
<br/>
In all the descriptions that I read, there was almost nothing written about the first two thirds of the route; it was this ice-arête that took all their attention, and when they were writing about the ice-arête you got the impression they were really inspired. And I couldsee why. The arête was so steep on both sides that we were basically crawling on it a few steps at time. The only way that we could belay ourselves was that if one of us were to fall the other one was supposed to jump down the other side of the arête! On the both sides abysses led down to the rocks and from there to the glacier 900 meters below. Understandably, we were very cautious.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/ice"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- Igor starting the lead on the ice</span><br/></div>
<br/>
At one point we started traversing to the right because we wanted to go around the rognon- the rock that stretched all the way to the top. There we climbed on ice belaying with ice-screws. It was dark and the ice slope grew steeper as we went up. At one point when it was my turn to belay Ekalabhya to come to me, the slope was so steep I couldn’t stand normally and I had to hang on the ice-screws. We were joking that it was good that it was dark we would probably be not so relaxed if we could see where we were.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, we were only climbing and climbing, undisturbed by the height, the steepness, what lay to the right or left of us; only the cold disturbed us. I would climb to my stance and shiver uncontrollably whilst I was waiting for Ekalabhya to come to me and continue climbing another rope-length. When I saw my gloves frozen solid, I just had to laugh at the situation we were in.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Ekalabhya about the time and he said that it was exactly midnight. From then on, we continued climbing in silence. We just wanted to reach the end. We reached an area laden with crevasses. I was supposed to lead that part; I pointed the light of my headlamp in all directions but I couldn’t see any logical way to go. In the end, I just picked a direction and went because I didn’t want to stay in one place too long. I was climbing through very nice forms of ice with some crevasses to one side. When I reached my stance it was such a position that I thought that there is no way back and that we had to push straight. I couldn’t really see what was up there in the dark but I could see the lights at the summit. When Ekalabhya came and continued I could see from his light that we were very close to the top alright but his movements also showed me how bad the terrain was. When my turn came to start up I could see that I was right. The last two rope-lengths were full of hidden crevasses but Ekalabhya did a great job leading the way through and over them.<br/>
<br/>
At last, we reached the summit ridge and I could recognize the terrain. The track for the “White Valley” was going down on the other side and we were only a few minutes walk away to the tunnels of the Midi station.<br/>
<br/>
It was 3:00am when we arrived there. We had been climbing for 30 hours, 18 hours during the second day alone. After five hours we were on the glacier again, collecting our leftover gear and the tent, and happily looking back on route above us; this time our original apprehension had been replaced with a sense of satisfaction at a job well done.<br/>
<br/>
The climb was dedicated with gratitude to <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>.<br/></div>

<p>It is hard to say which is 'the' place of pilgrimage in the climber’s world. There are really so many places that deserve the title, places enchanted with the spirit of the climbing pioneers, names that instill respect and awe in every climber's heart.</p>
<p>Take the Dolomites, for example. A big chapter of the history of the modern rock climbing has been written in these Italian mountains with huge limestone faces and towers, signed by names as Comici, Dibona, Dimai, Preuss, Buhl, Solda, Cassin, Dulfer… Many climbs from the beginning of the 20th century were done here that even today’s climbers with their super-safe and reliable equipment would not dare to repeat, preferring instead to stay under the wall and try to imagine how the fellows from the black and white pictures ever managed it…</p>
<p class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin3" height="465" width="237"/>     <img class="c4" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin4" height="484" width="261"/></p>
<p>Last year I bought a guidebook in Chamonix, France that has the name “Classic Dolomite Climbs”. It is a nice guidebook that has at least one route for every corner of the Dolomites - a total of around 100 routes. Over the past year I have been reading through this book - each time after a few minutes I would get a headache trying to decide where I would actually like to climb...</p>
<p>For this first visit I decided on the routes concentrated around the Falzarego Pass – a mountain pass about 15km from the town of<br/>
Cortina d’Ampezzo where together with my wife, Vesna, we had our “base camp” in one of the town’s camping sites.</p>
<p>Thinking when we should go, the best invitation came – <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> was about to give three concerts in Italy at the end of May in Milano and Torino so we decided to head towards the mountains after these concerts. We were eagerly waiting for these concerts and for this visit of <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> in Europe - every time we came close to this spiritual Master we get so much inspiration by his selfless work to inspire everyone to reach deeper in their own lives. His concerts - where he plays on numerous instruments and sings songs that he has composed in his native Bengali language - are the best inner food that we could get for our planned trip.</p>
<p class="c5"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin1"/>      <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin2"/></p>
<p>After the concerts we headed towards Cortina and there we made our plan of when we are going to do the selected climbs that were:</p>
<p>Mountain (height) - route (name)<br/>

<p>I don’t like to rush things, and when it comes to climbing in an area  where I am visiting for the first time I like to start from easier ground so that I can gauge the lie of the land, so to speak. For this visit we decided to do easier routes that did not exceed the IV+ grade of difficulty (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). Climbing up to VI on a traditional alpine-style routes in our local crags and a bit harder on a well protected bolted routes - but this and the fact that these routes are termed “classic” might give you the false impression that everything was so easy…</p>
<p>“Climbing in the high mountains is to be enjoyed most when the difficulties (and not just those of a technical nature) are well within one’s capabilities and the mind is free to explore things on a deeper level”… we wanted to live up to this quote taken from the guidebook, and have a nice and enjoyable mountain experience.<br/></p>
