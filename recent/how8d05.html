            <p class="documentDescription">...The spiritual way</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p><tt><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK">While <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>'s students have run ultramarathons, swum the</span></tt> <span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>English Channel and broken world endurance records in numerous</tt> <tt>fields, one feat of endurance has so far eluded them: climbing Mount</tt> <tt>Everest. If one intrepid group has its way, however, this might be</tt> <tt>next on the list.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Of course, it will be no small achievement. Though more people have</tt><tt>climbed Everest over the past 50 years than have swum the Channel,</tt> <tt>the height of 8,850 metres (29,035 feet) still seems an almost</tt> <tt>mythical quest (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/high14">The Highest 14...</a>).</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>One of the most experienced climbers on the team is New Yorker</tt> <tt>Anugata B., who has swum the Channel, completed several</tt> <tt>ultramarathon races, and run across the Sahara Desert. "I think the</tt> <tt>Channel gave me the confidence to climb mountains," he says.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Though he swam the Channel back in 1988, mountain-climbing had</tt> <tt>intrigued him since his childhood, when he was watching National</tt> <tt>Geographic specials on TV. "I remember one in particular where they</tt> <tt>were climbing the Alps. I think it was Walker Spur. I remember being</tt> <tt>absolutely floored by watching it. I wasn't saying at the time that</tt> <tt>I wanted to do that, but it really struck a chord inside of me."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Here, he reveals his techniques for what might yet be his greatest</tt> <tt>achievement – techniques which have their basis in his spiritual</tt> <tt>life.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Play to your body's strengths</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>Part of his interest in mountain-climbing, he says, is due to his</tt> <tt>body's physical traits. "My physical body's made for endurance, as</tt> <tt>opposed to high-intensity sports like sprinting or even high-level</tt> <tt>rock climbing."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Climb with friends who have the same goal</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>These climbers were already long-time friends. "We've all been <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri</a></tt> <tt><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Chinmoy</a>'s meditation students for a very long time, on average about</tt> <tt>25 years," says Anugata, "so we were meditating and pursuing other</tt> <tt>sports well before the four of us ever started climbing.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"We realised we had a similar goal: to climb a high mountain, and to</tt> <tt>really experience the atmosphere and the consciousness of the</tt> <tt>mountain. Especially the Himalayas, because it's the traditional</tt> <tt>seat of meditation for yogis who meditate in caves.</tt> <tt>The combination of the sporting life and the spiritual life, in an</tt> <tt>environment like that, is really, really satisfying."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Meditate</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>Anugata meditates every day. "The actual act of meditation – sitting</tt> <tt>down and really silencing your mind, that real inner stillness – is</tt> <tt>not so easy. At least, not for long periods of time, given the</tt> <tt>intense activity of the Western lifestyle. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has always</tt> <tt>used athletics to augment the meditative experience."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Anugata and his friends see mountain-climbing as a spiritual</tt> <tt>experience. Take their expedition to Mount Cho Oyu, which is near</tt> <tt>Everest. At 8,201 metres (26,906 feet), it is the world's sixth</tt> <tt>highest peak (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/high14">The Highest 14...</a>).</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"We had a puja [ceremony] before we started. We meditated at base</tt> <tt>camp every day. We tried to make it a pilgrimage, not just an</tt> <tt>'attack' on the mountain – a word that some people use. We were in</tt> <tt>Tibet, and we really wanted to feel our oneness with Tibet, with the</tt> <tt>villages and people, and just continue that feeling right up the</tt> <tt>mountain. We didn't have any porters or any help climbing. It was</tt> <tt>just four of us – and our cooks, down at base camp. We all made it</tt> <tt>to the top.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"The consciousness up at the top, when you're walking around with</tt> <tt>low oxygen, is just not earthly. It's more like being in an</tt> <tt>airliner, when you look out the window in the morning, except</tt> <tt>there's no plane. Living in that environment for several weeks, it</tt><br/>
<tt>was really easy to meditate out there."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Build up to your goal</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>The same advice applies to almost everything. Anugata has taken many</tt> <tt>years, with several sub-goals on his way to the main one.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"If you're mountaineering, it's not a question of just bagging a</tt> <tt>peak, then going home and telling people what you did. That's</tt> <tt>probably part of it, but you've got to pay your dues, just like</tt> <tt>anything in life. You have to decide this is a priority and go about</tt> <tt>it in a conscious way. If you want to climb higher altitudes, like</tt> <tt>the 8000-foot peaks, start at lower altitudes and work up.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"I'd been climbing about 12 years at that point, maybe two or three</tt> <tt>trips a year. I was just practising in and around New York, or going</tt> <tt>to South America or China or Alaska. The four of us had done various</tt> <tt>things that led us to believe that we could handle this 8000-metre</tt> <tt>climb in low oxygen.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"First you learn how to handle the altitude and perhaps take care of</tt> <tt>yourself. You have to be prepared for what happens with the weather</tt> <tt>– unexpected storms and things like that. You have to be prepared</tt> <tt>for the incredible cold at 8000 metres. That cold is really due to</tt> <tt>the lack of oxygen. When you get up between 7000 metres and 8000</tt> <tt>metres, there's not much oxygen in your body. It's not burning and</tt> <tt>producing a lot of heat, so you have these down suits and a lot of</tt> <tt>insulation. You have to be very careful to take care of your</tt> <tt>appendages – your hands, your nose, your toes. So that's another</tt> <tt>aspect of being prepared.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"There's a little bit of technical climbing, and as you soon as you</tt> <tt>progress high enough and start to do vertical rock climbing, it's</tt> <tt>really a heavy-duty thing. It really comes from meditation… without</tt> <tt>letting any negative emotion get in there, and just for the moment,</tt> <tt>always being the best that you can be. That's going to be,</tt><br/>
<tt>ultimately, your best achievement.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"Half of mountaineering is taking care of yourself. You can't really</tt> <tt>expect someone, even if it's your guide, to come up to you at every</tt> <tt>moment and say, 'How ya doing?' They may say that, but you might not</tt> <tt>be able to tell them how it really is going. It's really important</tt> <tt>to pay into the sport, but responsibly – I want to stress the word</tt><br/>
<tt>'responsibly' – get to the point where you can climb at that level."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt class="c6">Make climbing part of your life-philosophy</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>"When you spend a long time in an activity, you tend to get inside</tt> <tt>the activity and inside yourself," Anugata says. "You just have more</tt> <tt>time to let the higher experience happen."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>However, this should happen naturally. The activity itself comes</tt> <tt>first. "It's become a philosophy as I've gotten older, but I think</tt> <tt>philosophy starts as something you just do physically. The</tt> <tt>philosophy gets built around it.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"In a zen sense, you get into the actual activity. Visiting</tt> <tt>remote places, the pure living out in the mountain drinking the</tt> <tt>glacier water, is just something that you feel satisfied doing. If</tt> <tt>you get to the summit of the peaks that you want to, that's a plus."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Prepare yourself for the power of the mountain</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>"It's easy to get a magazine about climbing and get some pictures of</tt> <tt>the people on Everest or one of the other 8000-metre peaks. You see</tt> <tt>people climbing, but what you don't get is the tremendous vibration</tt> <tt>of the place, which is really soulful.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>In that area of the world – Tibet, Nepal and Pakistan – where the</tt> <tt>really high mountains are, you get this feeling of tremendous power</tt> <tt>in the atmosphere. It's almost tangible. At the same time, you're</tt> <tt>feeling this inner strength. But the physical body is really</tt> <tt>struggling. You look at photos of people climbing… but you don't</tt> <tt>really get a feeling of what they're experiencing."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>When you follow in their footsteps, of course, it all becomes clear.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"You see that you're made up of various elements. You're not just</tt> <tt>the body. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has always taught us that there's the physical</tt> <tt>body, the vital energy, the mental energy, the heart power and the</tt> <tt>soul's power, and you start to see that separation when you get into</tt> <tt>very difficult athletic situations. The great art of meditation</tt> <tt>helps to clarify what's going on."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Do it with the greatest motives</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>This is an experience to be savoured – not just reaching the goal,</tt> <tt>but every part of the activity. "If you don't really enjoy it,</tt> <tt>there's not a great chance that you'll get to the top, because</tt> <tt>you're talking about a couple of months of approach and climbing,</tt> <tt>and there's definitely hardship involved."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>But while the activity might be difficult, Anugata says, enjoying it</tt> <tt>is a simple task. "The Everest climb might not even be your highest</tt> <tt>moment. Personally, I've had many of my own greatest moments. Many</tt> <tt>of them are not on the top of the mountain. Some of them are side</tt> <tt>issues to the climb. You can never tell when that moment of grace is</tt> <tt>going to descend on you. You're looking at the world with a new set</tt> <tt>of eyes.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"Getting ready, and taking the responsible steps to climb in the</tt> <tt>Himalayas, is just part of that. It's a whole path. We have a</tt> <tt>meditative path, and this is another path that is built around the</tt> <tt>meditative path.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"It's more about trying to see God within the world. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>'s</tt> <tt>philosophy is that he tries to see God's existence within the world.</tt> <tt>To get a glimpse of that is to get a foothold in that awareness. It</tt> <tt>requires us to try to silence ourselves, and get insight into what</tt> <tt>we are doing."</tt><br/>

            <p class="documentDescription">our climbing teams visiting these areas in June/July 2006</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p><span>The Peruvian team (Sakshama from Macedonia and Anugata from USA) did some very nice climbing. The acclimatization was done on Pisco(5752m) over a PD route, which was then followed by a climb on Urus (5420m, PD). After these climbs followed the main thing – the climb on the north face of Ranrapalca (6150m). This was done over the route Scandinavian Direct (TD/TD+), which rises about 900m and has difficulties up to V (UIAA scale) on rock and the icy slopes are up to 60-70 degrees. The team spent the night high in the mountain and in the morning satisfied with the climb Sakshama and Anugata returned in their base camp – (not reaching the summit that was about an hour away over easy terrain…) Due to a stormy weather they had to cancel the climb on Artesonraju (6025m)…</span></p>

<p><span>The team that was in the French Alps (Igor and Vesna Talevski from Macedonia) returned home satisfied only with the climbs planed for their acclimatization. Their main goal was the big Brenva Face of Mt. Blanc (4810m) but due to a storm they had to leave earlier. They climbed Mt Blanc du Tacul (4248m) over its normal route (PD-), the Cosmiques Ridge (PD+) of Aiguille du Midi (3842m) and a route on the North Face Triangle of Mt Blanc du Tacul called Left Edge (AD) that rises about 500m with some excellent mixed climbing… (<i>photos soon</i>)<br/></span></p>

<p>Question: What do you think is the best attitude for an athlete to have during training and during competition?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: The athlete, during practice, should feel that he is preparing himself to become a beautiful flower. Then, at the time of competition, he has to feel that he has grown into the beautiful flower and now is all ready to place himself at the Feet of his Lord Supreme. But I am talking about the seeker-athlete. If the athlete is not a seeker, then he has to feel that there is a special day for each and every thing in life. To observe that special day, we have to prepare ourselves for a long time. It is like a final examination. At the time of the final examination, we see the results of our preparation. An athlete cannot maintain his seriousness, his willingness and his enthusiasm at the same level throughout the year. So on one particular day, the day of competition, he can maintain all the good qualities that are needed to prove to the world at large that he is an excellent athlete.</p>
<p>Question: How can we sustain enthusiasm and freshness in our training and keep it from becoming tedious and boring?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: We can prevent training from becoming tedious and boring if we keep in mind that running is nothing short of a newly-blossomed flower which we are placing each day at the Feet of our Beloved Supreme. We have to feel that this newly-blossomed flower is our soul's daily awakening, a self-giving reality that each day we are offering to our Beloved Supreme. If we can maintain this experience while running, then we will never find our training tedious or boring.</p>
<p>Another way to sustain freshness and enthusiasm in our training is to have a sense of a clear, meaningful and fruitful goal. If we keep in mind this meaningful and fruitful goal, then enthusiasm and freshness will automatically dawn. If we value the goal, then the goal itself will give us enthusiasm and freshness. We are not aware of our goal's conscious eagerness to help us reach it.</p>
<p>The mother will stand at a particular place and wait for the child to come crawling or running toward her. But the mother is not only passively waiting and observing; she also has tremendous eagerness for the child to reach her. If the mother sees that the child is trying but not succeeding, she will come running toward the child. Similarly, in the inner world the goal actually comes toward the runner. If we value the goal and feel that the goal is something worthwhile, if we feel that it has boundless things to offer us, then naturally the goal itself will inwardly help us. The goal does not want us always to feel that it is a far cry; it wants us to reach it.</p>
<p>Question: Sometimes I feel like going out for a run, but something inside holds me back. It's like an inner battle going on. Yet when I do run I feel very happy.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: We are composed of the body, the vital, the mind, the heart and the soul. These parts are members of the same family. They are supposed to go together. The eldest brother is the soul. Then comes the heart, then the mind, then the vital, then the body. If they stand in line, one after the other, then the soul will be able to pull them - like string. If they are lined up in this way, then it will be very easy for the soul to pull them along.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it does not happen this way. The soul will go first, but the heart will not be there. Then with greatest difficulty, the soul will run to find where the heart is hiding. Meanwhile, the mind becomes rebellious and revolts. It says, "No, I won't go behind you." Then the vital becomes absolutely stubborn. It says, "No, I am not going at all!"</p>
<p>What will the body do? The poor body wants to go, but it is not getting any inspiration because the vital and mind are not supporting it. The body wants to go with the soul, so that the outer running will go along with the inner running. But the body sees that the mind does not want to go, the vital does not want to go and the heart does not want to go. Then the body starts doubting if it is doing the right thing. The body says, "If I am doing the right thing in following the soul, then how is it that the heart and the mind, my elder brothers, are not doing it? Perhaps I am not doing the right thing. Perhaps the soul is not telling me the right thing."</p>
<p>If the soul says to pray and meditate, it will be very easy for the body to believe. That is because as soon as we say 'soul', we think of God. We think that inside the soul is God, or that inside God is the soul; the soul and God go together. God has given the message of the inner and outer running to the soul. Now the soul is trying to bring the younger members - the heart, mind, vital and body - along with it. But when the heart, mind and vital do not join with the soul, then suspicion starts in the physical consciousness.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, first the heart says, "Why go out and run? It is time to pray and meditate." Then, after a few minutes, this same heart will have no more energy left to pray and meditate. It will say, "Let me go back to sleep." Then the mind is such a rogue! Whenever the heart is not in tune with the soul, at that time the mind listens to the heart and fully supports the heart. When this kind of separation starts, it is extremely difficult for the body to achieve anything here on earth, on the physical plane.</p>
<p>Question: How can I go faster? I find it so uninspiring to run slowly.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: To a great extent, speed in running starts with the mind. You have to develop more imagination. Imagine that you are running fast and appreciate your speed. Then let the thrill and joy that you get from your imagination inundate you. This joy will increase your speed. You can also think of some people who really do run fast and try to identify yourself with them.</p>
<p>In your case, you do not have to look very far. Your husband runs much faster than you do. You have seen him running fast many times, so you can identify your legs with his. The next time you go running, as soon as you start, feel that you have borrowed his legs and from then on, whenever you want to run, feel that you will be able to use his legs.</p>
<p>This is all based on imagination. Of course, you can take quite a few exercises to increase your speed. Limbering and stretching exercises will help a little. But imagination plays a great role in increasing speed.</p>
<p>Question: Some days I run much better and faster than others. How can I remain cheerful about my running on days when I cannot run my fastest?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Your running capacity changes every day because every day you are in a different consciousness. One day you feel light. One day you feel heavy. One day you feel inspiration and another day you feel no inspiration. But once you have been running for a while, you will have developed a basic running capacity, and this capacity will determine how fast you can run even on your slow days. If you can run a seven-minute mile, then one day if you are not in a dynamic mood, you will go at a nine or ten-minute pace. You will not go at a fourteen or fifteen-minute pace. Even on your worst day, you are not going to run slower than a nine or ten-minute pace.</p>
<p>On a slow day, if you want to maintain the same joy that you have when you are running well, you can play a trick on yourself. Imagine that instead of being forced to run at a ten-minute pace that day, you decided to run at that pace. If you feel that you are compelled to run slowly, then you will feel that your freedom has gone away, and you don't want to be anybody's slave. But if you feel that it was you who commanded your body to go at a ten-minute pace, then you won't feel miserable. Right from the beginning, if you feel that it was your decision to run at that speed, you will be as happy as if you were running at a seven-minute pace.</p>
<p>Question: Sometimes when I start to run I get angry, even furious.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: See if you have had enough rest. Perhaps you are compelling the body to run, but the body is not cooperating because you have not had sufficient sleep on those days. You have a very mild and kind nature, so I think that you are not getting enough rest at night. Then the following morning you curse yourself and ask yourself why you are running. You need more rest to calm your nerves.</p>
<p>Question: How careful should I be about choosing a running coach? What qualities should I look for?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Some coaches know many things worth learning, but they lead a very undivine life. If a coach has some spirituality in him along with his coaching capacity, then consider him. However, even if he is a good coach, if he is also full of aggressive, lower vital qualities, then be careful. Indirectly or unconsciously you will invite his undivine qualities into your own life.</p>
<p>We unconsciously try to emulate people. Many, many students ruin their lives when they are learning something from their teachers. A teacher may be good in his specific field, but when students become enamoured of the teacher's capacities and the teacher is not spiritual in the vast sense of the term, then unconsciously the students suffer. They lose their ideals. That is why very often I do not advise my students to take special instruction.</p>
<p>You have to be very careful and determine how much you can learn from a teacher without affecting your spiritual life. If you are very good in the spiritual life and start learning from a coach who is not very spiritual, even though you may start shining in your outer running, your life may be adversely affected. It may happen that your goal in life becomes totally different and you start to ignore your spiritual life. That would be a bad mistake. But again, you may be lucky enough to get a good coach. He does not have to be a disciple of a spiritual Master - far from it. He may be a spiritual person and not even be aware of his spirituality. There are many like that. If he has goodness, kindness, a clear mind and a sympathetic heart, then he is more than spiritual.</p>
<p>A runner may develop a very strong inner relationship with his coach. Then what happens? At the start of a run, or even during the race, if the runner invokes the presence of his coach - his style, his encouragement, his inspiration and dynamic push - at that time the runner can draw extra energy and extra force from his coach. Again, suppose there is some great runner that you look up to and idolise. Even if he is not your coach, if you consciously invoke his soul during the race, you can get added strength and added inspiration from him.</p>
<p>Question: How can our outer smile help our running?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Your outer smile can help your running considerably. When you smile, you disarm your opponent. Take running, for the time being, as your opponent. While you are fighting or struggling with your enemy, which is running, if you give a smile, naturally your enemy will lose some of its strength. So play a trick on your enemy by smiling. This may sound absurd, but I assure you it is true. Just think of the running world as an enemy and weaken the strength of this enemy by giving a smile.</p>
<p>Question: Why is a short run sometimes less comfortable than a long run?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: When you do a long run, you can go slowly and steadily like an Indian bullock cart. But when you run a short distance, in ten seconds it is over, so naturally you will feel uncomfortable. In a short distance, as soon as the gun is fired, you have to reach the goal. The starting point and the goal are at practically the same place. But in a long-distance run, the goal remains for some time a far cry. During the time that it takes you to reach the goal, you can discover your own way to be physically more comfortable during the run. You can measure your distance mentally and calculate your capacities in your own way; you have the time. But for a short distance, in only a few fleeting seconds you have to reach the goal. You have to give your body, vital, mind, heart and soul most forcefully, if not willingly, to the goal. Therefore, it becomes most uncomfortable.</p>
<p>There are only three winners: The one who competes with himself, The one who crosses the finish line first And the one who finishes the race.</p>
<p>Competition is good, Provided it is the competition Of self-transcendence And not the competition Of ego-demonstration.</p>
<p>The divine meaning of competition Is the manifestation of soulfulness In the outer life. The supreme meaning of competition Is the perfection of oneness In the inner life.</p>
