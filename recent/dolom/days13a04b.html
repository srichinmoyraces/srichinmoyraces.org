<p><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> gave the last concert in Torino on 30th May. We spent the night in the camp in the town and early in the morning we departed towards Cortina d’Ampezzo (via Venice and Belluno). Driving through highways all the way from Skopje we saw only plain fields and roads but when we started driving from Belluno towards Cortina the mountains started to show up and I started getting excited about the climbs getting so close. It was very satisfying finally driving through the scenic mountain roads and villages of Northern Italy and seeing the big walls of the mountains and towers rising out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/cort"/></p>
<p class="c3">- Cortina d'Ampezzo and the surrounding mountains</p>
<p>The period end of May / start of June is what is called “early” season in the Dolomites for climbing. The South sides of the mountains were clean of snow (as were all our chosen routes) but on the northern slopes there was still some snow to be found – especially in the steep and narrow gullies where we were supposed to pass on our way down. It was also off-season in the town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. When we arrived, the town was empty with only few people on the streets, many shops were closed due to “holidays” (for a month) and out of five camps only 2 were open. We settled down in the Cortina Camping and decided that next<br/>
day we would start our climbing.</p>
<p>31 May<br/>
Few routes had a start from the Falzarego Pass that is about 15km away from the town. This mountain pass is on 2117m height and we drove on the curved road from Cortina with a doubtful feeling about the weather since it was cloudy and grayish. As we arrived on the pass and looked towards Sass di Stria, the route we wanted to climb that day, we saw its top covered in clouds. Deciding to climb it anyway, we parked the car on the road towards Valparolla Pass where there is a small parking place “marked” with a big boulder on the left side. From here, there is a path that leads to the route that passes under the wall of the mountain and we came at the start in about 20 minutes. The start was marked with a driven in piton on the right side of the rib and putting the guidebook in my upper pocket of the backpack, after a moment of silence and concentration I headed up. The South Rib was first climbed by the Cobertaldo/Pezzoti party on 1 August 1939. It is an easy IV+ route (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>) that follows the right side of the rib with occasional turns on right (passing under harder, overhang-like problems) and one rightwards traverse on the last pitch over a big ledge that got us under the crux of the route – a IV+ crack that leads to the top. It was a good introduction route for the Dolomites. We used it to check out if the gradings in the guidebook are as same as or close to the gradings that we climb on our local crags and to feel the rock. In the first two pitches I felt the rock a little slippery but we got used to it very fast and what satisfied us as far as we have climbed on limestone this rock was very solid and firm. We liked it a lot. When we got on the top we had a very nice look towards the surrounding valleys and mountains and also we could see the Falzarego Torres that we wanted to do next.</p>

<p class="c3">-Sass di Stria and Vesna on top</p>
<p>1 June<br/>
This day we wanted to do 2 routes on the Two Torres di Falzarego that are c.2500m high. The route that we wanted to climb on Torre Piccola di Falzarego was on the South Arête, first climbed by Comici/del Torso/Varale party on 10 August 1934. It was graded IV+ and it had 7 pitches. The route on Torre Grande di Falzarego was on the West Face and was first climbed by S. Lussato on 13 August 1957. It was graded IV and it had 4 pitches. We wanted to do these routes in one day since when abseiling down from Torre Piccola we would come into the gap between the two towers and after short scramble in the gully we would be directly at the start of the other route. We parked the car about 1km before Falzarego Pass driving from Cortina at the parking of a restaurant and after a walk of about an hour we were at the start of the Piccola route. When I was ready to start I had a quick look at the watch that I had in the pocket of my backpack and it said 10:30. The route starts on a ledge about 10 meters to the right from the arête and after 2 pitches of IV/IV+ joins the arête. It was written that it starts under a painted number “10” – I could only see the painted number about 10 meters up from the ledge and it was only when I looked up the face standing at the foot of the chimney that is located at the far left side of this ledge that I saw it… Anyway, at the harder pitches there was enough in – situ protection and only the first 3 pitches were “the harder ones”. I would like to say that even when someone says that there is enough protection on some Dolomite route, you should always bring some slings and nuts because if you are not used to climb with in-situ protection on bigger distances you may find it “tricky”. After that it was easy climbing on grade III+ and we came to the top. There we saw few cemented belay bolts but the actual abseil station was located on a path few meters from the top when we looked down towards Torre Grande. From there we made a 25m abseil that brought us on a terrace from where we were supposed to go into the gap between the Torres… As we sorted out the gear in the backpacks, I looked at the watch and it said 15:30… 5 hours?!?! I could not believe my eyes. I told Vesna about this and we sat in silence for a while. We climbed the route without having almost any problem of route finding and it was all somehow much faster… We decided to go down.</p>

<p class="c3">- Falzarego Pass and the two Torres di Falzarego</p>
<p>When we came to the car there was one Italian climber (we climbed with him when he visited Macedonia) with a friend who said that he was surprised seeing us down instead of climbing another route since it was only 13:30. Now I could not believe my ears; I checked my watch and it said 16:30. After getting into the car I realized this watch had two timers (during the climb I probably unknowingly pressed the button for the timer to change…), and because I hardly ever used the two timers I completely forgot about them - and to make things worse, we could have easily climbed the other route also… Our friends climbed Sass di Stria that afternoon and Vesna and I went to find the start of a route that we wanted to do on Picolla Lagazuoi. We went that night for pizza and decided that we would have another try tomorrow  – with Vesna I would go on Torre Grande and our friends would repeat the route that we did today. We showed them the description, told them all they needed to know and the next day we split half way on the approach route and headed towards Torre Grande.  We saw where this route started the day before, so it was an easy start and easy climbing. The crux slabs were blackened with water, which made them slippery, but it was not a big problem since the route was short and this was only for about few meters. After an easy scramble of II/III at the last pitch we were on the top and we sat<br/>
relaxed for a while.</p>
<p>2 June<br/>
We cast our eyes towards Lagazuoi, since we wanted to do a route there and also towards Tofana di Rozes. We wanted to do 2 routes on this big mountain also but the conditions there were still bad. The exit route was still much under snow and a few friends who were hiking there the day before told us said a big avalanche came off passing very close to them. The south face during the days while we were there was always covered with clouds and we could not see as much as half of the wall. Coming down from Torre Grande was tricky. We put all our equipment in our backpacks since in the guidebook it was written that we have to “descent a short, chossy gully to a notch…from there less distinct path”… We thought this means an easy scramble down, but the gully was very exposed with walls going way down from each side and it was tricky climbing down through a very broken terrain. There were cemented rings, which we could use for abseil or mid-belay points coming down roped together but we didn’t want to take off the equipment from the backpacks so we moved very slowly and it was OK… On the way down we met with the two friends of ours – they came out mid way of the Piccola route since there were few parties climbing slowly in front of them. At Torre Piccola just when you will pass the first 3 pitches there is a ledge from where you can descend to a path that will get you on the approach route…So this was the third route that we did and for the next day we planned to do a route on Piccola Lagazuoi with which we would make a climb on all the mountains that are around Falzarego offered in the guidebook. We were having nice climbing but we were not very happy about the weather since every afternoon the sky would get covered with clouds and we couldn’t make a brave decision to climb something much longer the next day not knowing how the weather would go. Each morning when we would see that the sky had not so many clouds, we would go and climb this short routes but later in the day the weather would change (while climbing we could see how the clouds were coming over from the west) and it was raining almost every afternoon or night. But we decided to climb the 250m high wall of the Piccolo Lagazuoi anyway since it was not that big and the route was fairly easy, at least in the<br/>
guidebook description...</p>

            <p class="documentDescription">18/19 September 2004 - North Face of Aiguille du Midi by the route "Frendo Spur"</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<h3>Climbing up the North Face of Aiguille du Midi</h3>
<br/>
The many visitors that make the pilgrimage to the famous ski resort of Chamonix, France only have to look high up in the surrounding mountains to see the North Face of Aiguille du Midi. A short trip by lift gives them a unique opportunity to see every detail of all the major climbing routes, and sometimes one can even make out on the rockface the tiny spots of the climbers in action. During last year’s Alpine trip, I beheld the north face of Aiguille du Midi, and since then whoever asked me my plans for the next season was told emphatically that I want to go on Frendo, the imposing buttress that rises up almost straight through the middle of the big wall of Midi.<br/>
<br/>
The buttress is named after the Frendo-Rionda party, who did the first ascent by this route on 11 July 1941, followed twenty-three years later by the first winter ascent by the Stagni-Wohlschlag party on 21-22 January 1964. Our climb began on the seventeenth of September, 2004, when myself and my climbing partner, Ekalabhya, took what we needed for this climb up on to the glacier where we wanted to camp in order to have an early start the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/our route"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- The route</span><br/></div>
<br/>
I had spent all year reading as many descriptions as I could find  about the route, looking at some pictures, dreaming about it constantly - I thought that I knew everything there was to know. Maybe I did, but no amount of reading could have prepared me for that moment during our approach to the glacier when the true size of the task ahead dawned on me. 1200 meters of near-vertical rock face awaited us, starting up around 2600m and ending at the 3842 meters high summit. It was such an intimidating sight, and many times during our approach we had to avert our eyes as the the whole thing just became too mind-boggling. Everything that I thought I knew had just gone out the window. It was only when we set up our “base camp” and became occupied with the mundane jobs such as melting water that our anxiety went away and we could look at the route objectively, discussing matters such as where we could go faster and where we might have problems.<br/>
<br/>
We didn’t start particularly early the next morning and it wasnt untill 8:00am that we arrived under the rock itself, after a one-hour approach from our tent. The bergschrund (crevasse between the face and the glacier) was quite big and there was only one place were we could easily go on the rock. Up until now we had been quite calm and collected, but now we could see the true size of the rock features now that we were up close, and I was overwhelmed by the magnitude of it all. The north faces of the Alps are very cold during the whole day. At the beginning every touch on the rock was very uncomfortable but we were concentrating only on the climbing itself and after some time we forgot about the cold.<br/>
<br/>
We were climbing without any rest stops, trying to make our first bivouac place as high as possible, bearing in mind the last lift down from the mountain the next day left at 5:00pm. We didn’t have any problems finding our way on the rock - there was only one real route up, along the ridge, on either side of which there were only abysses and hold less slabs. From time to time we would find some leftovers from other climbing parties: cams, nuts, slings, a few pitons…<br/>
<br/>
The only problem was to get higher. But, not having acclimatized at all, we were moving increasingly more slowly the higher we ascended. Just before it got dark, we came under a vertical pillar that was raising four or five rope lengths up. We decided to sleep there,as we were unsure as to whether there was any better place to sleep further on. The sleep wasn't brilliant, to say the least. It got to the point when we would wake up because of the cold, wriggle around to warm up enough to go back to sleep, only to wake up again, and again...<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, the buttress rising up right in front of us did not seem half as scary as it was when we approached it from the glacier the day before. We knew where we should go, so we went. From that moment on the technical difficulty level of the climb was raised a notch or two and there was one or two times I really regretted not bringing my climbing shoes with me instead of the big plastic boots that I had. But once we started to encounter the parts with snow, I was more glad I brought my boots. We had been climbing for what seemed like ages and yet we still couldn’t see the start of the section where the rockface become covered completely in snow and ice. We changed the lead for what seemed like countless times. Finally we came to the snow arête where we could put on our crampons. From there we could see the station at the summit and we were confident that we would make it there before five o’clock. But it did not happen that way...<br/>
<br/>
In all the descriptions that I read, there was almost nothing written about the first two thirds of the route; it was this ice-arête that took all their attention, and when they were writing about the ice-arête you got the impression they were really inspired. And I couldsee why. The arête was so steep on both sides that we were basically crawling on it a few steps at time. The only way that we could belay ourselves was that if one of us were to fall the other one was supposed to jump down the other side of the arête! On the both sides abysses led down to the rocks and from there to the glacier 900 meters below. Understandably, we were very cautious.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/ice"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- Igor starting the lead on the ice</span><br/></div>
<br/>
At one point we started traversing to the right because we wanted to go around the rognon- the rock that stretched all the way to the top. There we climbed on ice belaying with ice-screws. It was dark and the ice slope grew steeper as we went up. At one point when it was my turn to belay Ekalabhya to come to me, the slope was so steep I couldn’t stand normally and I had to hang on the ice-screws. We were joking that it was good that it was dark we would probably be not so relaxed if we could see where we were.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, we were only climbing and climbing, undisturbed by the height, the steepness, what lay to the right or left of us; only the cold disturbed us. I would climb to my stance and shiver uncontrollably whilst I was waiting for Ekalabhya to come to me and continue climbing another rope-length. When I saw my gloves frozen solid, I just had to laugh at the situation we were in.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Ekalabhya about the time and he said that it was exactly midnight. From then on, we continued climbing in silence. We just wanted to reach the end. We reached an area laden with crevasses. I was supposed to lead that part; I pointed the light of my headlamp in all directions but I couldn’t see any logical way to go. In the end, I just picked a direction and went because I didn’t want to stay in one place too long. I was climbing through very nice forms of ice with some crevasses to one side. When I reached my stance it was such a position that I thought that there is no way back and that we had to push straight. I couldn’t really see what was up there in the dark but I could see the lights at the summit. When Ekalabhya came and continued I could see from his light that we were very close to the top alright but his movements also showed me how bad the terrain was. When my turn came to start up I could see that I was right. The last two rope-lengths were full of hidden crevasses but Ekalabhya did a great job leading the way through and over them.<br/>
<br/>
At last, we reached the summit ridge and I could recognize the terrain. The track for the “White Valley” was going down on the other side and we were only a few minutes walk away to the tunnels of the Midi station.<br/>
<br/>
It was 3:00am when we arrived there. We had been climbing for 30 hours, 18 hours during the second day alone. After five hours we were on the glacier again, collecting our leftover gear and the tent, and happily looking back on route above us; this time our original apprehension had been replaced with a sense of satisfaction at a job well done.<br/>
<br/>
The climb was dedicated with gratitude to <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>.<br/></div>

<p>It is hard to say which is 'the' place of pilgrimage in the climber’s world. There are really so many places that deserve the title, places enchanted with the spirit of the climbing pioneers, names that instill respect and awe in every climber's heart.</p>
<p>Take the Dolomites, for example. A big chapter of the history of the modern rock climbing has been written in these Italian mountains with huge limestone faces and towers, signed by names as Comici, Dibona, Dimai, Preuss, Buhl, Solda, Cassin, Dulfer… Many climbs from the beginning of the 20th century were done here that even today’s climbers with their super-safe and reliable equipment would not dare to repeat, preferring instead to stay under the wall and try to imagine how the fellows from the black and white pictures ever managed it…</p>
<p class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin3" height="465" width="237"/>     <img class="c4" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin4" height="484" width="261"/></p>
<p>Last year I bought a guidebook in Chamonix, France that has the name “Classic Dolomite Climbs”. It is a nice guidebook that has at least one route for every corner of the Dolomites - a total of around 100 routes. Over the past year I have been reading through this book - each time after a few minutes I would get a headache trying to decide where I would actually like to climb...</p>
<p>For this first visit I decided on the routes concentrated around the Falzarego Pass – a mountain pass about 15km from the town of<br/>
Cortina d’Ampezzo where together with my wife, Vesna, we had our “base camp” in one of the town’s camping sites.</p>
<p>Thinking when we should go, the best invitation came – <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> was about to give three concerts in Italy at the end of May in Milano and Torino so we decided to head towards the mountains after these concerts. We were eagerly waiting for these concerts and for this visit of <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> in Europe - every time we came close to this spiritual Master we get so much inspiration by his selfless work to inspire everyone to reach deeper in their own lives. His concerts - where he plays on numerous instruments and sings songs that he has composed in his native Bengali language - are the best inner food that we could get for our planned trip.</p>
<p class="c5"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin1"/>      <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin2"/></p>
<p>After the concerts we headed towards Cortina and there we made our plan of when we are going to do the selected climbs that were:</p>
<p>Mountain (height) - route (name)<br/>
1. Sass di Stria (2477m) - South Rib<br/>
2. Torre Picola di Falzarego(c.2500m) - South Arete<br/>
3. Torre Grande di Falzarego (c.2500m) - West Face (Lassato Route)<br/>
4. Piccolo Lagazuoi (2778m) - South-West Face (Via del Buco)<br/>
5. Piz Popena Basso(2224m) - East Face (2 routes)<br/>
6. Cinque Torri (Torre Barancio 2308m) - (2 routes: North Face, and North West Corner)<br/>
7. Punta Fiames(2240m) - South Face (Via Comune)</p>
<p>I don’t like to rush things, and when it comes to climbing in an area  where I am visiting for the first time I like to start from easier ground so that I can gauge the lie of the land, so to speak. For this visit we decided to do easier routes that did not exceed the IV+ grade of difficulty (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). Climbing up to VI on a traditional alpine-style routes in our local crags and a bit harder on a well protected bolted routes - but this and the fact that these routes are termed “classic” might give you the false impression that everything was so easy…</p>
<p>“Climbing in the high mountains is to be enjoyed most when the difficulties (and not just those of a technical nature) are well within one’s capabilities and the mind is free to explore things on a deeper level”… we wanted to live up to this quote taken from the guidebook, and have a nice and enjoyable mountain experience.<br/></p>
