            <p class="documentDescription">Day 2 - Aletschgletscher...</p>
<div class="documentBody"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The second day we have another glacier to walk along and then to cross: the biggest (I wish to say “hugest”) glacier in</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Europe</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, the Aletschgletscher. This is the day I will come to know how much the difference between the eight of us who DO have crampons and the many others who DON’T is. These crampons will come in like God’s Grace and will enable us today to do things the others cannot attempt. We will wander freely and wildly about almost anywhere on the glacier, unbound to its stony parts, edges, or sides. We leave the conventional routes. Anyway, there isn’t really any such thing as route, as there are no signs, no footsteps, the glacier changes its face every year, every month, every day and every hour. The small holes left by the spikes of the leader’s crampons are just like the natural snow-holes shaped by a heavily falling wet snow. The ridges are all alike, once you climb onto the top of any of them, they just look like another and yet another frozen giant wave of a petrified ocean framed by snow-covered mountains.</span>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And what is between the ridges is the abysm. Deep cracks. Sometimes man can simply step over, not thinking of the consequences of a false step, sometimes man jumps over, and sometimes they are just far too wide: you better turn back, find another way through. It is a Mynotaurus’ job as it is really a labyrinth and except for the guide’s instinct, orientation skills and comprehensive sight, there is absolutely no other hint or clue on directions.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">When it comes to jumping, it is always of a moment of intensity. A moment of victory over something very ancient that still prevails in man. Everybody can jump a meter, or one and a half even, unless he is seriously blessed or handicapped. But how many can jump one and a half meter without the slightest concern if -very obviously- there is nothing (just a deep gap) between the two ends of that meter? We will belong to the group of those who don’t mind the dark void below and just jump. One more inveterate habit of the human psyche has been overcome. I am grateful to my crampons. Even if I don’t always manage to perfectly land on the top edge of the other side, they get a grip and stick me to the aimed shore, not allowing me to slip down into the crevasse. Oh yes, God’s special spiky Grace comes very handy at this moment. On top of that these jumps remind me of a Zen story that is absolutely applicable to our situation: 'with small steps one cannot cross over a crevasse', said once a master to a disciple when the latter one asked him about how to overcome attachment <i>gradually</i></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<div class="c4"/>
<div class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl1"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl2"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl3"/></span><br/></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At the edge of the glacier, towards the mid-section of it, at the place where the gap between the ice-blocks and the rocky body of a side-peak closes, although still far from the rocks, still balancing gingerly on the crusty back of an immense frozen labyrinth, we start seeing colours! Actually white and grey and only one more colour: blue. Light blue with all its nicest hues and shades. Sky blue, turquoise, cobalt blue, cyanide-like blue, peace-blue, sea-blue and what not? There are myriads of bluish hues each one appearing somewhere in the depths of a crevasse, a breach, a wide gap, a torn mouth of the glacier... Now the ice-sea reveals its nicest face, makes itself unprecedentedly attractive. But if one looks deep into these mystic blue depths, still it is depth, danger and death the one is ought to see.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">This is Maya, the wonderful illusion of beauty and sublime forms, irresistibly drawing man towards herself. I literally have to force myself to keep my eyes on the guide, on the rope, on the next jump between two crevasse-walls, above yet another marvel-blue gap offering the perspective of ten or thirty or more meters of void below my feet. Thank God I was told before how to behave, thank God, my Master had spoken to me about Maya. This time there is no fall, I manage to cross all crevasses, avoid all treacherous snow-bridges and breath-thin ice-layers covering a two centigrade cold running water-stream... I just follow the leader, my eyes alternately moving from his step to the rope and then to my step, I faithfully trudge after him, raise arm, push the ski-stock and the crampons to where he stepped a few seconds before, go alongside small ridges, across crest-like hunches, just follow him silently, and I too am followed silently. The glacier doesn’t manage to devour any of us. One more hour and we reach the point where we cross from ice to rock first climbing down the gap and then up the wall. My crampons have an amazingly good grip on a totally smooth rock face.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Soon we find ourselves amidst a debris of boulders and a road up to some saddle of a mountain. Crampons and rope off, we will just walk up. (Of course this walk doesn’t exactly mean walk, but it is still a safe upward road, with no additional security devices needed, cables being installed through the tougher sections.) Only a hundred meters of altitude difference and we have a more complete, somewhat distant and therefore comprehensive view of the central sections of the glacier and its bend. Breath-taking, exhilarating and challenging. We try to look back to where we have come from, but that is lost somewhere in space. We see however the last one or two kilometre long wandering section of the glacier, the labyrinth we have been in. Thousands of ridges separated by thousands of crevasses, abysses, blue holes to loose yourself in… I feel a sort of self-contempt especially when we shake hands with the group leader and he congratulates us for accomplishing the tough parts without accidents. We thank him on our turn. After all, it was his skills, experience, knowledge of the mountain, instinct of the glacier and above all, attention and patience that dragged us along and across two glaciers in two days. He coils the rope and says nothing. The blueness of a summit-background sky is lost in his eyes, he is thinking of the next trip already...<br/></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Finally, the hardest lesson comes: we are off the glacier, far from the crevasses, gone through the moraine, rock-climbed one of the walls neighbouring the giant body of the glacier, as we gain height on the slope where thousands of boulders of various size were cast by some titan architect, we see more and more of this 900 meters (2700 feet) thick block of ice and snow AND yet the end is beyond our reach... there remains still slope after slope, half-vertical boulder-fields petrified before a fatal fall, then steep rock and then ice-covered rock and then a fresh-snow-covered avalanche field and only far above all these are the ridges, crests and cols connecting summits and high-points of our earth’s noble back.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The journey doesn’t end until it takes toll even on our absolutely last drop of strength, concentration, patience, swiftness and breath. Had it not been for God’s Grace in form of the guide, the map, the crampons, the avalanches that did NOT launch themselves to rush on us, it would be a total failure I have to report. But God’s Grace is somehow there, at the right place, at the right moment. I am prone to believe that this is our last and only chance... Final lesson for today, you may have a rest now, before embarking again.</span></p>

            <p class="documentDescription">18/19 September 2004 - North Face of Aiguille du Midi by the route "Frendo Spur"</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<h3>Climbing up the North Face of Aiguille du Midi</h3>
<br/>
The many visitors that make the pilgrimage to the famous ski resort of Chamonix, France only have to look high up in the surrounding mountains to see the North Face of Aiguille du Midi. A short trip by lift gives them a unique opportunity to see every detail of all the major climbing routes, and sometimes one can even make out on the rockface the tiny spots of the climbers in action. During last year’s Alpine trip, I beheld the north face of Aiguille du Midi, and since then whoever asked me my plans for the next season was told emphatically that I want to go on Frendo, the imposing buttress that rises up almost straight through the middle of the big wall of Midi.<br/>
<br/>
The buttress is named after the Frendo-Rionda party, who did the first ascent by this route on 11 July 1941, followed twenty-three years later by the first winter ascent by the Stagni-Wohlschlag party on 21-22 January 1964. Our climb began on the seventeenth of September, 2004, when myself and my climbing partner, Ekalabhya, took what we needed for this climb up on to the glacier where we wanted to camp in order to have an early start the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/our route"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- The route</span><br/></div>
<br/>
I had spent all year reading as many descriptions as I could find  about the route, looking at some pictures, dreaming about it constantly - I thought that I knew everything there was to know. Maybe I did, but no amount of reading could have prepared me for that moment during our approach to the glacier when the true size of the task ahead dawned on me. 1200 meters of near-vertical rock face awaited us, starting up around 2600m and ending at the 3842 meters high summit. It was such an intimidating sight, and many times during our approach we had to avert our eyes as the the whole thing just became too mind-boggling. Everything that I thought I knew had just gone out the window. It was only when we set up our “base camp” and became occupied with the mundane jobs such as melting water that our anxiety went away and we could look at the route objectively, discussing matters such as where we could go faster and where we might have problems.<br/>
<br/>
We didn’t start particularly early the next morning and it wasnt untill 8:00am that we arrived under the rock itself, after a one-hour approach from our tent. The bergschrund (crevasse between the face and the glacier) was quite big and there was only one place were we could easily go on the rock. Up until now we had been quite calm and collected, but now we could see the true size of the rock features now that we were up close, and I was overwhelmed by the magnitude of it all. The north faces of the Alps are very cold during the whole day. At the beginning every touch on the rock was very uncomfortable but we were concentrating only on the climbing itself and after some time we forgot about the cold.<br/>
<br/>
We were climbing without any rest stops, trying to make our first bivouac place as high as possible, bearing in mind the last lift down from the mountain the next day left at 5:00pm. We didn’t have any problems finding our way on the rock - there was only one real route up, along the ridge, on either side of which there were only abysses and hold less slabs. From time to time we would find some leftovers from other climbing parties: cams, nuts, slings, a few pitons…<br/>
<br/>
The only problem was to get higher. But, not having acclimatized at all, we were moving increasingly more slowly the higher we ascended. Just before it got dark, we came under a vertical pillar that was raising four or five rope lengths up. We decided to sleep there,as we were unsure as to whether there was any better place to sleep further on. The sleep wasn't brilliant, to say the least. It got to the point when we would wake up because of the cold, wriggle around to warm up enough to go back to sleep, only to wake up again, and again...<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, the buttress rising up right in front of us did not seem half as scary as it was when we approached it from the glacier the day before. We knew where we should go, so we went. From that moment on the technical difficulty level of the climb was raised a notch or two and there was one or two times I really regretted not bringing my climbing shoes with me instead of the big plastic boots that I had. But once we started to encounter the parts with snow, I was more glad I brought my boots. We had been climbing for what seemed like ages and yet we still couldn’t see the start of the section where the rockface become covered completely in snow and ice. We changed the lead for what seemed like countless times. Finally we came to the snow arête where we could put on our crampons. From there we could see the station at the summit and we were confident that we would make it there before five o’clock. But it did not happen that way...<br/>
<br/>
In all the descriptions that I read, there was almost nothing written about the first two thirds of the route; it was this ice-arête that took all their attention, and when they were writing about the ice-arête you got the impression they were really inspired. And I couldsee why. The arête was so steep on both sides that we were basically crawling on it a few steps at time. The only way that we could belay ourselves was that if one of us were to fall the other one was supposed to jump down the other side of the arête! On the both sides abysses led down to the rocks and from there to the glacier 900 meters below. Understandably, we were very cautious.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/ice"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- Igor starting the lead on the ice</span><br/></div>
<br/>
At one point we started traversing to the right because we wanted to go around the rognon- the rock that stretched all the way to the top. There we climbed on ice belaying with ice-screws. It was dark and the ice slope grew steeper as we went up. At one point when it was my turn to belay Ekalabhya to come to me, the slope was so steep I couldn’t stand normally and I had to hang on the ice-screws. We were joking that it was good that it was dark we would probably be not so relaxed if we could see where we were.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, we were only climbing and climbing, undisturbed by the height, the steepness, what lay to the right or left of us; only the cold disturbed us. I would climb to my stance and shiver uncontrollably whilst I was waiting for Ekalabhya to come to me and continue climbing another rope-length. When I saw my gloves frozen solid, I just had to laugh at the situation we were in.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Ekalabhya about the time and he said that it was exactly midnight. From then on, we continued climbing in silence. We just wanted to reach the end. We reached an area laden with crevasses. I was supposed to lead that part; I pointed the light of my headlamp in all directions but I couldn’t see any logical way to go. In the end, I just picked a direction and went because I didn’t want to stay in one place too long. I was climbing through very nice forms of ice with some crevasses to one side. When I reached my stance it was such a position that I thought that there is no way back and that we had to push straight. I couldn’t really see what was up there in the dark but I could see the lights at the summit. When Ekalabhya came and continued I could see from his light that we were very close to the top alright but his movements also showed me how bad the terrain was. When my turn came to start up I could see that I was right. The last two rope-lengths were full of hidden crevasses but Ekalabhya did a great job leading the way through and over them.<br/>
<br/>
At last, we reached the summit ridge and I could recognize the terrain. The track for the “White Valley” was going down on the other side and we were only a few minutes walk away to the tunnels of the Midi station.<br/>
<br/>
It was 3:00am when we arrived there. We had been climbing for 30 hours, 18 hours during the second day alone. After five hours we were on the glacier again, collecting our leftover gear and the tent, and happily looking back on route above us; this time our original apprehension had been replaced with a sense of satisfaction at a job well done.<br/>
<br/>
The climb was dedicated with gratitude to <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>.<br/></div>

<p>It is hard to say which is 'the' place of pilgrimage in the climber’s world. There are really so many places that deserve the title, places enchanted with the spirit of the climbing pioneers, names that instill respect and awe in every climber's heart.</p>
<p>Take the Dolomites, for example. A big chapter of the history of the modern rock climbing has been written in these Italian mountains with huge limestone faces and towers, signed by names as Comici, Dibona, Dimai, Preuss, Buhl, Solda, Cassin, Dulfer… Many climbs from the beginning of the 20th century were done here that even today’s climbers with their super-safe and reliable equipment would not dare to repeat, preferring instead to stay under the wall and try to imagine how the fellows from the black and white pictures ever managed it…</p>
<p class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin3" height="465" width="237"/>     <img class="c4" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin4" height="484" width="261"/></p>
<p>Last year I bought a guidebook in Chamonix, France that has the name “Classic Dolomite Climbs”. It is a nice guidebook that has at least one route for every corner of the Dolomites - a total of around 100 routes. Over the past year I have been reading through this book - each time after a few minutes I would get a headache trying to decide where I would actually like to climb...</p>
<p>For this first visit I decided on the routes concentrated around the Falzarego Pass – a mountain pass about 15km from the town of<br/>
Cortina d’Ampezzo where together with my wife, Vesna, we had our “base camp” in one of the town’s camping sites.</p>
<p>Thinking when we should go, the best invitation came – <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> was about to give three concerts in Italy at the end of May in Milano and Torino so we decided to head towards the mountains after these concerts. We were eagerly waiting for these concerts and for this visit of <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> in Europe - every time we came close to this spiritual Master we get so much inspiration by his selfless work to inspire everyone to reach deeper in their own lives. His concerts - where he plays on numerous instruments and sings songs that he has composed in his native Bengali language - are the best inner food that we could get for our planned trip.</p>
<p class="c5"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin1"/>      <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/doloin2"/></p>
<p>After the concerts we headed towards Cortina and there we made our plan of when we are going to do the selected climbs that were:</p>
<p>Mountain (height) - route (name)<br/>
1. Sass di Stria (2477m) - South Rib<br/>
2. Torre Picola di Falzarego(c.2500m) - South Arete<br/>
3. Torre Grande di Falzarego (c.2500m) - West Face (Lassato Route)<br/>
4. Piccolo Lagazuoi (2778m) - South-West Face (Via del Buco)<br/>
5. Piz Popena Basso(2224m) - East Face (2 routes)<br/>
6. Cinque Torri (Torre Barancio 2308m) - (2 routes: North Face, and North West Corner)<br/>
7. Punta Fiames(2240m) - South Face (Via Comune)</p>
<p>I don’t like to rush things, and when it comes to climbing in an area  where I am visiting for the first time I like to start from easier ground so that I can gauge the lie of the land, so to speak. For this visit we decided to do easier routes that did not exceed the IV+ grade of difficulty (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). Climbing up to VI on a traditional alpine-style routes in our local crags and a bit harder on a well protected bolted routes - but this and the fact that these routes are termed “classic” might give you the false impression that everything was so easy…</p>
<p>“Climbing in the high mountains is to be enjoyed most when the difficulties (and not just those of a technical nature) are well within one’s capabilities and the mind is free to explore things on a deeper level”… we wanted to live up to this quote taken from the guidebook, and have a nice and enjoyable mountain experience.<br/></p>
