<div class="documentBody">
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">If you suspect that this essay will be about mountaineering you are right. If you think that I am just going to talk about spiritual lessons you are also right. I always felt that the two things can have much in common. And my Master is always obliged to find new ways of teaching me, or summarising whatever I have so far learnt. This is how I plunged deep into snow-white spaces for a couple of days and emerged (or was rather pulled out</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>J</span></span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">from dark hollow crevasses, tied onto a 9 mm rope), utterly addicted to adventure.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">To make readers’ life less miserable, I will try to avoid the technical jargon. I will try to explain things for those who have never tasted this kind of food.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Let’s just pretend it was a dream. <br/></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">So, I see myself on a rainy, gloomy, dark grey, absolutely hopeless Thursday afternoon, sitting on the floor of my office, adjusting crampons onto my snow-proof boots...<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/ajg2"/>              <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/ajg1"/>            <img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/greben"/><br/></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I see myself running to catch a train the same evening, then interminably waiting for another train at midnight in the a deserted railway station of a not so well-known, albeit big west-German city, where only the local pub-fairy and local beggar find me to ask for sponsorship... an offer I generously refuse.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And I see poor me thereafter, pulling myself together before getting off a train and then again getting on two more trains in</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Switzerland</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. Quite a boring dream isn’t it? Imagine, I have seen this quite often in the recent past! Well, that’s the dark side of mountaineering: the distance you have to cover until you reach the mountain. Just like the multitude of lives we have to crawl through till the moment comes for us to see the point in all that.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">So, I see myself again, leaning against the window of a narrow-railway mountain train, feeding myself on the exhilarating, spectacular view of some yet unknown, unsuffered three-four thousand meter high summits... and a glorious rainbow there, no, not up in the sky, but rather down, below our trail, in a blooming early-July valley!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I see myself gasping for air later on at 1900 meters when a determined wave of wind finally comes to my appeal and lifts several layers of fog and mist, unveiling what is known to the present day as the ‘cimborasso’ of alpine climbing, the uttermost challenge in Europe’s mountaineering, the culminating combination of danger and difficulty: EigerMORDwand, the Killing Northern Wall of Eiger, the Monster that claimed so many valuable lives and that destroyed so many flourishing climbing careers and success stories. A place of pilgrimage for me, the poor beginner who would never even venture risking my life at the sheer foot of this disastrously whimsical mountain god! I inwardly bow to the giant and try to get as far as possible before another flock of Japanese or Indian tourists invades every little accessible panorama-viewing corner. No wonder, the place is too popular for it is terribly spectacular, reachable without any physical effort (quite unusual for a place of pilgrimage) AND because Japanese climbers successfully conquered this notorious North Wall in 1969, what more is, they actually opened a new, direct route to the top. Therefore, without exception, every Nipponese visitor will have a picture or video-shot of it, plus one more of his/her own self with the mountain in the background – if the Monster condescends to show its face...

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I am supposed to acclimatise a bit, to get higher and higher very gradually, but there are just toooooo many folks in here, attracted by the easy reach of the Top of Europe, the Jungfraujoch, the highest altitude railway station, post office and Bollywood style restaurant of our continent. So I rather put my gaiters, coat and hat on and rush into another small (and already packed!) train, rudely chasing away all conscience conflicts and emerging ideas about fair ways of reaching high on a mountain (ways that totally exclude vehicles!). I am doing exactly the same thing that these Tourists do –it hurts me, it is painful to the adolescent in me, who would rather die than spare an hour of ascension)!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Then I see myself mesmerised by the Eiger glacier yet a little higher at approx. 2800 meters altitude. It is neither an encouragement nor a hopeful perspective for me, concerned about the venture I am about to start...</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I see myself exiting a tunnel at 3400 meters, quite released that the crowd of tourist slowly ceases to follow the same direction. Oh yes, there is cold and snow outside! They prefer to watch it from behind the huge glass walls of an amazingly well-designed infrastructure in the mainstream of the Swiss Alps.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And then I see myself no more! I actually see a big white blank-out, some patches of golden-white sky gently leaning against an immensity of half-vertical white field... Without my sunglasses in two hours I would go blind! Everything is white and you can literally bite into cosmic radiation and diffuse sunlight...</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The last thermometer I saw at the meteorological station indicated minus 6 Celsius grades, but I actually feel like walking on an enormous hypocaust system, heated by reflected and direct light as well as plain, unobstructed radiation. I am bound to imagine myself now, as I cross an utterly unknown, mystic field hanging between a four thousand meter high ridge and a glacier with its upper curtain starting somewhat higher than 3500 m. I start walking into the unknown. It’s a walk into white light with a totally reduced physical visibility and cosmos-wide room for inner vision. Yes, the sphere of protons and helium nuclei penetrating this space from the wide and vast Universe. Unfortunately, I have to command halt to the inner vision that perceives now the Supreme being in diamond-shine shapes: all I must see now is but the next sign indicating that I am still heading in the right direction. God knows that I am here, anyway. He, well, for me, the weak but heavy-bodied brown-haired woman in her thirties and her water-proof jacket, he is “she” and this she knows that I am totally alone. Journeying into the unseen something that the marriage of a mountain saddle and a giant glacier can ever offer... “She” knows also that I am neither lonesome, nor unhappy. I am more than the contrary of these.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">She takes good care of me. An inner voice knocks in, gently speaks my mother tongue and commands me: don’t err, don’t improvise. Just go on, without a meter of pacing off-tray. All improvised short-cuts take you to an abyss. I don’t see, but I feel and I remember from seeing the map that at my right is the mountain, the western wall of Moench and at my left there is the slope and crevasses of the Jungfraufirn glacier (which is my goal for tomorrow). And in between there is my shadowless shape wandering on, taking deep breaths of a rarified air and bright-white glow. Without the imminent danger, it would be a feeling I could call “trance”. But this is a rather conscious state of mind. Be sober, be reasonable, don’t make any stupidity. I walk on, trudging in the mildly falling snow and the light of a thousand suns behind its veil.</span></p>
<div class="c7"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">Altitude sickness</span></span></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Unavoidably it comes. After four or five hours in the hut at approx. 3650 meters (11976 ft) it slowly downs on me that I actually have to throw up. Thank God, the hut-owner provided air-sickness bags everywhere. Let us not go more into details, I filled quite a few of them. In clear moments when I refill the eliminated waters of my body and wait for the next attack which doesn’t delay coming, I try to think of my Master and of what he said on altitude sickness. The remedy seems to be the joy of transcending the height-limits. If only my tightly constricted stomach would understand that I AM happy! With a totally emptied belly, no water (as nothing stays in me at this moment!) in my dried-out body and overworked head, what makes me then happy about the sheer fact that I can see nothing but snow and snow-white ridges all around, that I can imbibe this rarified air and densified radiation in minus 6 Celsius grades and in a mild 27 km/ hour wind? My dear unknown friend, who dare infiltrating into my diary, if you have not gotten the mountain virus, you will never understand this… Actually, I don’t understand it either.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">True, a lotus is a kind of flower that likes difficulty, if you think that it grows with tightly, tensely gripped petals in the dirtiest waters, resists this medium all the way through, before it finally pushes its head above and then it doesn’t want to stop until it grows higher than any other water plant... But having this kind of a soul, does it really mean I can only be happy in hardship?</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Yet, seemingly and realistically: I am happy here now while throwing up and on the other hand I have a hard fight trying to put things to the right place. Am I meant to do this at all? With my lack of physical capacities and unsportsmanly body how far can I drag myself just for the sake of this yearning for vastness and intensity?</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">If this nausea is the end, if this is what I had fought for...(if this is what I had run uphill for, tortured myself with push-ups for, if this is what I had walked through endless snow-fields for, if this is what I had worked and prayed for)... oh, well, then I guess I better walk down nicely, go home and start playing table tennis instead. I look deep inside myself. To my satisfaction, this glimpse is not limited by the walls of a gym hall and a ping-pong ball flying here and there. No! What lives in my inner eyes is an age-long yearning for distance within sight, for spaces below my feet, for ridges that lead me while I am balancing above a two-sided void. What lives in my inner heart is longing for vastness, for the picture of dozens of blue parallel ridgelines and the wind eternally lifting and dropping clouds. What abides in my inner mind is an unbreakable aspiration always to get higher and higher until one’s vision can encompass the rest of the world in its totality, from above.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">All ailment will have to go away, I am not meant to collapse here, emptied of all physical contents with a pale face! Slowly by slowly I get better. The headache wouldn’t stop for a minute, but at least the next gulp of water doesn’t trigger any volcanic reaction. I am being pulled together, I can think normal, climb down the stairways and up again. It is just the pain in brain that tortures me relentlessly. God, where are you?<br/></span></p>

<p class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Then all of a sudden four Gods walk in. None of them less than six feet tall, the cream of British Lake District climbers makes an appearance here after having successfully climbed Moench, the brother</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">mountain</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">of</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Eiger</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. They were the four men in black – nearing the summit – I saw from the col of the mountain this afternoon! In seconds the deserted, empty entry hall becomes a warehouse of entangled ropes, ice axes, crampons, harnesses hanging from everywhere. A world I somehow feel more comfortable in.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">I try to look less disgusting with all these full nausea bags around me, but they actually don’t seem to look down on me for that. Two of them happen to be doctors! And one of them happens to have the same kind of headache. In memory of this new British-Transsylvanian mountaineering friendship we share a couple of Aspirins. Later on a French climber lady tells us that this was the best thing we could have taken for altitude disease. She takes one a day each day she spends above a certain height and never has problems ever since she discovered this. Again I learned something. The time the remedy takes for healing me is quite long however. Basically the whole night! I use this time for praying for protection. Later on I will come to know that this was a very wise thing, I really needed what I asked for.<br/></span></p>
<p class="c10"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">DAY 1</span><br/></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Next morning is the morning of a slow trek down to the other valley and also of the quest of a Master. I hope you don’t mind the metaphor, I just mean that it took me some time to find the mountain guide I was allotted to. We look at each other. I know at first sight that he is an old mountain bear, familiar with every little crack and every big gully labyrinth of the glacier, absolutely at ease at handling any equipment and danger situation should it come to a rescue operation. And he probably knows of me immediately that I work in an office, have overweight problems and am not very confident when it is a matter of physical skills. He probably also feels how badly I want yet to do this trip. To have the taste of the unknown. When I put the harness in, with a strong pull he tests whether I adjusted the clips well, closed the screw karabiner properly etc. He is satisfied and that gives me some confidence. But at the end, when we clip ourselves onto the rope, he makes the knot himself to be sure that I am safe. Now I (and the other rope-mates) have become his responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The strongest of the team is a 27 year old Swiss boy; none would contest his good endurance and strength. He is at the end of the rope. The weakest is actually me, so I am just next after the leader, that is: second to the guide. We keep a distance from each other, so that the rope is tight (or almost) for in case of a fall, closeness would mean that more than one person is pulled down by the bodyweight of the falling companion. And we start this comfortable descent into the very body and heart of the glacier. Silence invades, envelopes everything and everyone. For hours and hours we only speak when someone gets into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">From the altitude of 3400 meters we will descend to 2600 and then climb up a laddered wall (an easy "via ferrata") back to 2800 to sleep there in a hut. But this is just the altitude difference. The distance we have to cover is, of course, much longer and it definitely is much less safer than merely walking five hours. Below our feet is a 900 meter deep ice cube, cut and ploughed a million times by the natural erosion, rich in cuts and abrasions and furrows and cracks and crevasses and holes and precipices and gullies and what not! And all these are covered with snow or are abridged by snow-plates to the point of being totally masked.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Sometimes one doesn’t walk on the glacier, but on a layer of thickened consistent snow with a hollow space under it! And sometimes these snow-bridges don’t resist man’s bodyweight. These are the moments when the soil (well, the snow carpet beneath) suddenly opens below your feet and in a second you find yourself hanging on a rope above a black emptiness of an unknown depth (anything from nine to almost nine hundred ! meters). In lucky cases one of your feet or at least your hands, arms still have something solid to hold onto, your upper body may be bent or leaning on snow with your lower body in the absolute nothing, but even then it is quite a manoeuvre to liberate yourself from the pull of dark depth and eventually of this porridge-like snow rim that may prevent your thigh from being lifted above the ground (quasi the other shore of the snow-crevasse).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">It is hard to imagine if you haven’t experienced it yet, and I admit, to me it was a scary feeling. I just wonder how I could be so rational when it first happened. At an unfortunate step I found myself doubled with my stomach and two arms hugging the snow where fifteen seconds ago the guide had stepped, while one of my feet lost all ground, I could only see some dark distance below it. My other leg was entangled in the wet snow wall of the crevasse. In seconds interfered some sober mind that wasn’t probably the real mind: 'don’t look down into the bottom, do it fast, but do it gingerly'. It still took me some time to cautiously overcome the situation without further ruining my snow bridge (the part of it that didn’t break and fall down). It is like trying to climb up a hopper or a funnel that is turned upside down, or like coming up from a bottle through its tightening neck. And on top of this, this neck is so fragile, so vulnerable. A wrong movement would send my only (seemingly solid) support down into the hole and then I would loose all ground, all fixed spot, testing what it feels like to be a spider with only the rope holding my weight. So, without ruining the place where one has to step next, one gently forces oneself to the surface, sometimes even the people closest in the rope can give him a pull and one is up again. Until the next fall</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span>J</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At the second bad luck event, I was grateful to the rope, to the guide who held it and I fully agreed with my much more experienced climber friend D, who had told me well beforehand 'a glacier is always life-threatening if you cross it on your own'. The parallel is also very clear: without a master one should definitely not venture into the advanced mountaineering fields of spiritual life, unless one is tempting suicide. Without strong people around you in the same rope, falling into a crevasse like this can very easily turn into a fatal experience right from the beginning. And this is yet nothing compared to the higher glaciers of our earth, the ice-falls of the Himalayas where you don’t simply walk ON TOP of these fragile ice and snow bridges and features, but also, you are bound to risk going INTO and BELOW and BETWEEN them, sometimes on all fours, sometimes in vertical, sometimes balancing through precariously placed metal ladders spanning over giant gaps etc. But let mstay with my limited experience and capacities for the moment.<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c7"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><span class="c6">‘Never ever do that’</span></span></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">After a couple of hours of cautiously trudging in the snow and still before I had the first experience of loosing the ground beneath my feet we stopped for a few minutes. We got a little closer together to have a chocolate, an apple, whatever. At this point I decide to go near the only other girl in our group of eight adventurers. Since I don't want to entangle the rope I just unclip myself, put the rope down and walk towards her. In seconds I hear the reproaching voice of the guide: 'What are you doing? Where do you think you are?'</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Uh, he is right, too right. I am on a glacier. I am above hollow spaces that - at places- only some fragile snow plates separate from me. And right now I am not even secured!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The two and half meters back to my knot in the rope have become a much longer distance. I make my way back sweating while the others look on, but - should I fall below- cannot help. A great lesson: never unclip yourself of the rope. You cannot leave just like that, or you expose yourself to danger.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">During the next hour I come to appreciate this rope (and the boundedness it means) three times, for I experience three (thank God, minor) falls.</span></p>
<span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">This night I know that I will have nightmares. If not nightmares than just vague movie clips right before falling asleep and all of them will end up with some black deep hole suddenly opening below my weight. No, I don't want that, anything but to revive these real pictures again. At this point my joy knows no bounds when I find my mp3-player in one of the pockets of the rucksack. How much I hesitated whether I should carry this little extra weight or leave it at home. Finally I squeezed it in the pocket "just in case". Nothing better can happen to me now. My Master's voice always helped me until now, whenever I was in a bad mood, low consciousness, prone to fear or tantrums. It does help this time also. Before the battery goes down due to the cold, I can listen to two poems at least. And my anxiety is gone along with those creepy pictures and scary feeling. His voice chases away my fear and my unpleasant memories of the day. I plunge in a healthy slumber for at least three hours. Then comes the predecessor of sunrise, the first dark purple ray of light cutting the Zulu night away from the snow-covered ridge above the hut. And it is no longer snowing. We might have a great day today.</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Four forty</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. The first climbers put their equipment on and set off. I stare at them, inwardly wish them safe tryouts and yearn to be like them one day: brave, daring, easy-hearted while pacing off in the dark daybreak.</span>

<p><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> gave the last concert in Torino on 30th May. We spent the night in the camp in the town and early in the morning we departed towards Cortina d’Ampezzo (via Venice and Belluno). Driving through highways all the way from Skopje we saw only plain fields and roads but when we started driving from Belluno towards Cortina the mountains started to show up and I started getting excited about the climbs getting so close. It was very satisfying finally driving through the scenic mountain roads and villages of Northern Italy and seeing the big walls of the mountains and towers rising out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/cort"/></p>
<p class="c3">- Cortina d'Ampezzo and the surrounding mountains</p>
<p>The period end of May / start of June is what is called “early” season in the Dolomites for climbing. The South sides of the mountains were clean of snow (as were all our chosen routes) but on the northern slopes there was still some snow to be found – especially in the steep and narrow gullies where we were supposed to pass on our way down. It was also off-season in the town of Cortina d’Ampezzo. When we arrived, the town was empty with only few people on the streets, many shops were closed due to “holidays” (for a month) and out of five camps only 2 were open. We settled down in the Cortina Camping and decided that next<br/>
day we would start our climbing.</p>
<p>31 May<br/>
Few routes had a start from the Falzarego Pass that is about 15km away from the town. This mountain pass is on 2117m height and we drove on the curved road from Cortina with a doubtful feeling about the weather since it was cloudy and grayish. As we arrived on the pass and looked towards Sass di Stria, the route we wanted to climb that day, we saw its top covered in clouds. Deciding to climb it anyway, we parked the car on the road towards Valparolla Pass where there is a small parking place “marked” with a big boulder on the left side. From here, there is a path that leads to the route that passes under the wall of the mountain and we came at the start in about 20 minutes. The start was marked with a driven in piton on the right side of the rib and putting the guidebook in my upper pocket of the backpack, after a moment of silence and concentration I headed up. The South Rib was first climbed by the Cobertaldo/Pezzoti party on 1 August 1939. It is an easy IV+ route (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>) that follows the right side of the rib with occasional turns on right (passing under harder, overhang-like problems) and one rightwards traverse on the last pitch over a big ledge that got us under the crux of the route – a IV+ crack that leads to the top. It was a good introduction route for the Dolomites. We used it to check out if the gradings in the guidebook are as same as or close to the gradings that we climb on our local crags and to feel the rock. In the first two pitches I felt the rock a little slippery but we got used to it very fast and what satisfied us as far as we have climbed on limestone this rock was very solid and firm. We liked it a lot. When we got on the top we had a very nice look towards the surrounding valleys and mountains and also we could see the Falzarego Torres that we wanted to do next.</p>

<p class="c3">-Sass di Stria and Vesna on top</p>
<p>1 June<br/>
This day we wanted to do 2 routes on the Two Torres di Falzarego that are c.2500m high. The route that we wanted to climb on Torre Piccola di Falzarego was on the South Arête, first climbed by Comici/del Torso/Varale party on 10 August 1934. It was graded IV+ and it had 7 pitches. The route on Torre Grande di Falzarego was on the West Face and was first climbed by S. Lussato on 13 August 1957. It was graded IV and it had 4 pitches. We wanted to do these routes in one day since when abseiling down from Torre Piccola we would come into the gap between the two towers and after short scramble in the gully we would be directly at the start of the other route. We parked the car about 1km before Falzarego Pass driving from Cortina at the parking of a restaurant and after a walk of about an hour we were at the start of the Piccola route. When I was ready to start I had a quick look at the watch that I had in the pocket of my backpack and it said 10:30. The route starts on a ledge about 10 meters to the right from the arête and after 2 pitches of IV/IV+ joins the arête. It was written that it starts under a painted number “10” – I could only see the painted number about 10 meters up from the ledge and it was only when I looked up the face standing at the foot of the chimney that is located at the far left side of this ledge that I saw it… Anyway, at the harder pitches there was enough in – situ protection and only the first 3 pitches were “the harder ones”. I would like to say that even when someone says that there is enough protection on some Dolomite route, you should always bring some slings and nuts because if you are not used to climb with in-situ protection on bigger distances you may find it “tricky”. After that it was easy climbing on grade III+ and we came to the top. There we saw few cemented belay bolts but the actual abseil station was located on a path few meters from the top when we looked down towards Torre Grande. From there we made a 25m abseil that brought us on a terrace from where we were supposed to go into the gap between the Torres… As we sorted out the gear in the backpacks, I looked at the watch and it said 15:30… 5 hours?!?! I could not believe my eyes. I told Vesna about this and we sat in silence for a while. We climbed the route without having almost any problem of route finding and it was all somehow much faster… We decided to go down.</p>
<p class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/falpass"/><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/torre2"/><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/torre"/></p>
<p class="c3">- Falzarego Pass and the two Torres di Falzarego</p>
<p>When we came to the car there was one Italian climber (we climbed with him when he visited Macedonia) with a friend who said that he was surprised seeing us down instead of climbing another route since it was only 13:30. Now I could not believe my ears; I checked my watch and it said 16:30. After getting into the car I realized this watch had two timers (during the climb I probably unknowingly pressed the button for the timer to change…), and because I hardly ever used the two timers I completely forgot about them - and to make things worse, we could have easily climbed the other route also… Our friends climbed Sass di Stria that afternoon and Vesna and I went to find the start of a route that we wanted to do on Picolla Lagazuoi. We went that night for pizza and decided that we would have another try tomorrow  – with Vesna I would go on Torre Grande and our friends would repeat the route that we did today. We showed them the description, told them all they needed to know and the next day we split half way on the approach route and headed towards Torre Grande.  We saw where this route started the day before, so it was an easy start and easy climbing. The crux slabs were blackened with water, which made them slippery, but it was not a big problem since the route was short and this was only for about few meters. After an easy scramble of II/III at the last pitch we were on the top and we sat<br/>
relaxed for a while.</p>
<p>2 June<br/>
We cast our eyes towards Lagazuoi, since we wanted to do a route there and also towards Tofana di Rozes. We wanted to do 2 routes on this big mountain also but the conditions there were still bad. The exit route was still much under snow and a few friends who were hiking there the day before told us said a big avalanche came off passing very close to them. The south face during the days while we were there was always covered with clouds and we could not see as much as half of the wall. Coming down from Torre Grande was tricky. We put all our equipment in our backpacks since in the guidebook it was written that we have to “descent a short, chossy gully to a notch…from there less distinct path”… We thought this means an easy scramble down, but the gully was very exposed with walls going way down from each side and it was tricky climbing down through a very broken terrain. There were cemented rings, which we could use for abseil or mid-belay points coming down roped together but we didn’t want to take off the equipment from the backpacks so we moved very slowly and it was OK… On the way down we met with the two friends of ours – they came out mid way of the Piccola route since there were few parties climbing slowly in front of them. At Torre Piccola just when you will pass the first 3 pitches there is a ledge from where you can descend to a path that will get you on the approach route…So this was the third route that we did and for the next day we planned to do a route on Piccola Lagazuoi with which we would make a climb on all the mountains that are around Falzarego offered in the guidebook. We were having nice climbing but we were not very happy about the weather since every afternoon the sky would get covered with clouds and we couldn’t make a brave decision to climb something much longer the next day not knowing how the weather would go. Each morning when we would see that the sky had not so many clouds, we would go and climb this short routes but later in the day the weather would change (while climbing we could see how the clouds were coming over from the west) and it was raining almost every afternoon or night. But we decided to climb the 250m high wall of the Piccolo Lagazuoi anyway since it was not that big and the route was fairly easy, at least in the<br/>

<div class="documentBody">
<p><span class="c3">Demir Kapija is an area in South-Central Macedonia about 120 km f</span><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">rom</span> <span class="c4"><tt>Skopje. A journey down the Skopje-Solun (Greece) highway or a railway</tt> <tt>connection will take you to the small settlement of the same name. The</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river Vardar separates the settlement of Demir Kapija from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>the big limestone rockface that rises up right from the left bank of</tt> <tt>the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river (making it hard to approach for climbing). The rock itself is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fragile - like any other limestone but also because it has not been</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed very often – frequent climbing “cleans up” the rock by pushing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down the loose rocks or even blocks, but here in Demir Kapija you could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">till find some dangerous patches, not because of the technical</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ifficulty but because of the potential danger of falling rocks. On the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ther hand, there still remains many possibilities for new routes. The</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span><tt><span class="c3">xisting routes are about 200-250 metres long</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">(d</span><span class="c3">epending where they</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">s</span><tt><span class="c3">tart) and in the IV-VI grading area.</span></tt></p>
<p><span class="c4"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/pristap1" height="167" width="252"/><span class="c4"><img class="c5" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/prist2" height="178" width="263"/></span></span></p>
<p><span class="c4">-The approaches</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>There are two ways to approach the routes - one by climbing up over to</tt></span></p>
<tt><span class="c3">the top and following a marked path that leads down over at times</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>difficult ground, or the second way over the highway.</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">There are two tunnels on the highway (about 500m after the junction for</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the town) and after passing the first one there is a little stream on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the right that goes towards the river where you can find a fixed steel</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cord so that you can traverse towards the routes. Usually we take the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">second approach because it is much faster and safer, but when the river</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is too high, we go around taking the other way. Getting down is easy.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">From the top there is a trail that leads down to the highway and from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>there into the town, but because it is not very well marked we</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">followed</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the ridge which then met up with the trail - from there on it was easy.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<tt>With Vesna</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">we</span> <span class="c3">have climbed 4 routes in this area - Tulumba,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Polzav, Slavkova and Blazeva. Vesna also has climbed the route Vlatceva</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with another climber. Tulumba and Polzav are two of the longest</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">existing routes. They start close to each other and have a common exit</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">– they share the last pitch. The grades in these routes are up to V but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">they are concentrated mainly in the first two pitches and in the last</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">one. The last third of the first pitch of Tulumba has one overhang</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which I passed using one little rock that was stuck in the wide crack</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cutting the upper part of the overhang in half. Usually when you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climb on</span> <span class="c3">harder rocks these moves give you real joy because of their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">unusual quality, but not here - climbing in such a fragile environment</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made me feel a little queasy about having to use this kind of handhold.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>But this was the only way, so first I put a sling around the rock for</tt> <tt>protection and after that I grabbed the rock, pulled on it, and moved</tt> <tt>on as quickly as I could. The first pitch on Polzav also finds you</tt> <tt>under a small overhang. I had to combine</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the handholds for my left hand on the overhang with the slab on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right where there were no good footholds at all - I had to climb using</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friction moves and</span> <span class="c3">reaching with my left hand as far as I could over</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the overhang. In both cases it was a real relief when I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">out of it. There were good belay stances above and I secured Vesna –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">she came out of these</span> <span class="c3">“problems” with a smile on her face since she</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could enjoy climbing concentrated only on the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and not worrying about holding on loose pieces of rock. The middle two</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches are easy III scrambling. The routes (like all the others here)</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">do not</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>have enough protection “in situ”, so climbing here means having your</tt> <tt>cams, nuts, slings and pitons prepared. The hardest moves in the routes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">are “clean” – the rock here is not (very) fragile so we were free to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">concentrate only on the moves. It is where the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">are</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">not as high that the terrain and the rock gets more fragile – but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that’s also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">part of the climbing… Vlatceva starts also close to these routes but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">has a more straight line and ends up also more to the right. When you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">look at the rock from the other side of the river the line of the route</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(few meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the right of Tulumba) is visible, following wide and narrow cracks</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">up the rockface…</span></tt>
<p><span class="c4"><img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/tulslav" height="163" width="267"/><img class="c7" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/igor" height="178" width="290"/></span></p>
<p>-Pozav(left) and Tulumba (right)</p>
<p><br/>
<tt>Slavkova is a shorter route that starts somewhere on the half of the</tt> <tt>rock, but much harder and here the crux reaches up to VI+ grade. The</tt> <tt>line of the route is far from “diretissima” - it just starts and goes</tt> <tt>up fearlessly towards the hardest technical</tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulties that are in its way. After some easy scrambling from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">river bank we got under the route which starts following a dehidre and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ends up few meters under the overhangs.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">The first belay stance is actually at the tree on the top of this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">dehidre after which the route goes up the slab and traverse to the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right. After this there is a line that will get you right under the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first overhang. Here the climbers feel (and are) very exposed. The hand</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and foot holds are such a position that we had to move almost lying</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">bodies horizontally in the air, turned sideways on the rock and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stretching over as far as we could to the right. The overhanging area</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is so big that when climbers move through the first overhang they can</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see the ground 200 meters under their legs … The first overhang can be</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed following a crack that moves diagonally to the right towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the second overhang. We made the second belay stance under the second</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhang because there was a drag on the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and I just couldn’t move through something this difficult pulling up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with my hand or body. The correct line goes straight up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the second overhand, but if you want to climb it free without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">using the pitons</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“in situ” for aid climbing but you can’t because it’s just not your</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day, you can go around to the right. We didn’t do this - but I must say</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that I was not successful passing this overhang from the first try</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(even second, third…:) There is enough protection “in situ” through the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhangs and in the area over and under them, but not enough in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first pitch where we used the crack that we followed that is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cam-friendly.</span></tt></p>
<p><img class="c8" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/slavk1" height="175" width="274"/><img class="c9" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/previs" height="169" width="266"/></p>
<p>-Slavkova route and climbers under the second overhang<br/>
<br/>
<tt>Blazeva is easy long route where the crux of grade VI is in the last</tt> <tt>7-8 meters where the route gets a little overhangy. For a route of</tt> <tt>around</tt> <tt><span class="c3">250</span> <span class="c3">metres this means pleasant long climb with beautiful views over the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridges that this route follows. The start is over an easy and wide</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">chimney (IV+/V) with lot of possibilities for putting cams and slings.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">But the rock here is more fragile and I had to be very careful how I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was climbing and what I was holding to because everything that would</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">brake would fall directly down on Vesna through the chimney where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">her belay stance was. After the first pitch there are two or three easy</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of easy II/III scrambling. Here we moved parallel and when we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">got at the point where the route gets more vertical we made the belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stance. From here on it gets a little harder but the rock was very</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hospitable for belay means. The last (very short) pitch has a grade VI</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and it starts on a big terrace where we enjoyed the views on the both</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sides of the canyon. The name “Demir Kapija” actually means “Iron</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Gate”. The canyon is like a gate from one valley to another so being on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a top or close gives you unique opportunity to see how the river curves</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the valleys on the both sides. The last pitch can be also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed by another</span> <span class="c3">variation that goes a little towards to the left</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">where we found big handholds and big cracks for cams (I could see a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">old and rusty pitons on my right that were from the harder variation).</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">These were the only “in situ” protection that we saw in this route.</span></tt></p>
<p><tt><span class="c3"><img class="c10" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/blaz" height="142" width="282"/><span class="c4"><img class="c11" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/abz" height="209" width="287"/></span></span></tt></p>
<p><span class="c4">-The upper part of Blazeva</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>The Demir Kapija area is one of the hottest places in Macedonia (if</tt> <tt>not the hottest), so usually we don’t climb here during the summer</tt> <tt>period. The rock faces south so during the whole day</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">climbers are exposed under the sun and climbing on temperatures high</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">over 40 degrees Centigrade can be very exhausting… Still between the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tunnels, there is enough protection and shade and there are some short</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sport-climbing routes that can be done if it is really hot. There are</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>good places for putting up a tent near the small stream that also</tt> <tt>passes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">through</span> <span class="c3">here.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This was the place where, 7 years ago, I began climbing unprotected big</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">routes and I had to plan the route all by myself. I remember during</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first climb I was so concentrated</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on what I was doing while climbing that I only started noticing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">surroundings after reaching the upper half of the route. During</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first hour or two of climbing I couldn’t see anything else around</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only the gray rock, the forms on it, cracks, hand and footholds - I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">so concentrated climbing and protecting my climbing partner that it was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only after some time that I started seeing the valley. It was like</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being awakened from sleep - looking at the surrounding</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">environment, the river that was passing down there, the train, the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">town. It was like the picture was slowly getting filled piece by piece.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was amazed by this effortless concentration that climbing got me in…</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">In few books written by climbers I’ve read how they compare this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">activity with meditation. Meditation, like climbing, gives you a rare</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">opportunity to analyze</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">yourself and go deep and find your limitations and go over them. I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">remember a quote from one climber (unfortunately I can’t remember who</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that) who said that only when we will climb the mountains that are in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ourselves, the mountains of jealousy, fear, anxiety, only then we will</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">be on the highest mountain of the world…</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This is what <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> says about concentration and meditation:</tt></span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><tt>“…Concentration is the open secret of focusing all one’s attention on</tt> <tt>a particular object or person in order to enter into and have one’s</tt> <tt>identification with that object or person. The final stage of</tt> <tt>concentration is to discover and reveal the hidden ultimate Truth in</tt> <tt>the object of concentration. What concentration can do in our</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">day-to-day life is unimaginable. It most easily separates our heart’s</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Heaven from our mind’s hell so that we can live the constant delight</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and joy of Heaven and not in the perpetual worries, anxieties and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tortures of hell while we are on earth…”</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>“Meditation is man’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering. When</tt> <tt>men’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering meet together man becomes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">immortal in the inner world and God becomes fulfilled in the outer</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">world…It is only through meditation that we can get lasting peace,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">divine peace. If we can meditate soulfully in the morning and receive</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">peace for only one minute, that one minute of peace will permeate our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">whole day…We need meditation because we want to grow in Light and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fulfill ourselves in Light…”</span></tt></p>
