            <p class="documentDescription">Day 2 - Aletschgletscher...</p>
<div class="documentBody"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The second day we have another glacier to walk along and then to cross: the biggest (I wish to say “hugest”) glacier in</span> <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Europe</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, the Aletschgletscher. This is the day I will come to know how much the difference between the eight of us who DO have crampons and the many others who DON’T is. These crampons will come in like God’s Grace and will enable us today to do things the others cannot attempt. We will wander freely and wildly about almost anywhere on the glacier, unbound to its stony parts, edges, or sides. We leave the conventional routes. Anyway, there isn’t really any such thing as route, as there are no signs, no footsteps, the glacier changes its face every year, every month, every day and every hour. The small holes left by the spikes of the leader’s crampons are just like the natural snow-holes shaped by a heavily falling wet snow. The ridges are all alike, once you climb onto the top of any of them, they just look like another and yet another frozen giant wave of a petrified ocean framed by snow-covered mountains.</span>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">And what is between the ridges is the abysm. Deep cracks. Sometimes man can simply step over, not thinking of the consequences of a false step, sometimes man jumps over, and sometimes they are just far too wide: you better turn back, find another way through. It is a Mynotaurus’ job as it is really a labyrinth and except for the guide’s instinct, orientation skills and comprehensive sight, there is absolutely no other hint or clue on directions.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">When it comes to jumping, it is always of a moment of intensity. A moment of victory over something very ancient that still prevails in man. Everybody can jump a meter, or one and a half even, unless he is seriously blessed or handicapped. But how many can jump one and a half meter without the slightest concern if -very obviously- there is nothing (just a deep gap) between the two ends of that meter? We will belong to the group of those who don’t mind the dark void below and just jump. One more inveterate habit of the human psyche has been overcome. I am grateful to my crampons. Even if I don’t always manage to perfectly land on the top edge of the other side, they get a grip and stick me to the aimed shore, not allowing me to slip down into the crevasse. Oh yes, God’s special spiky Grace comes very handy at this moment. On top of that these jumps remind me of a Zen story that is absolutely applicable to our situation: 'with small steps one cannot cross over a crevasse', said once a master to a disciple when the latter one asked him about how to overcome attachment <i>gradually</i></span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
<div class="c4"/>
<div class="c4"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"><img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl1"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl2"/>             <img src="http://my.srichinmoyraces.org/climbing/recent/gl3"/></span><br/></div>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At the edge of the glacier, towards the mid-section of it, at the place where the gap between the ice-blocks and the rocky body of a side-peak closes, although still far from the rocks, still balancing gingerly on the crusty back of an immense frozen labyrinth, we start seeing colours! Actually white and grey and only one more colour: blue. Light blue with all its nicest hues and shades. Sky blue, turquoise, cobalt blue, cyanide-like blue, peace-blue, sea-blue and what not? There are myriads of bluish hues each one appearing somewhere in the depths of a crevasse, a breach, a wide gap, a torn mouth of the glacier... Now the ice-sea reveals its nicest face, makes itself unprecedentedly attractive. But if one looks deep into these mystic blue depths, still it is depth, danger and death the one is ought to see.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">This is Maya, the wonderful illusion of beauty and sublime forms, irresistibly drawing man towards herself. I literally have to force myself to keep my eyes on the guide, on the rope, on the next jump between two crevasse-walls, above yet another marvel-blue gap offering the perspective of ten or thirty or more meters of void below my feet. Thank God I was told before how to behave, thank God, my Master had spoken to me about Maya. This time there is no fall, I manage to cross all crevasses, avoid all treacherous snow-bridges and breath-thin ice-layers covering a two centigrade cold running water-stream... I just follow the leader, my eyes alternately moving from his step to the rope and then to my step, I faithfully trudge after him, raise arm, push the ski-stock and the crampons to where he stepped a few seconds before, go alongside small ridges, across crest-like hunches, just follow him silently, and I too am followed silently. The glacier doesn’t manage to devour any of us. One more hour and we reach the point where we cross from ice to rock first climbing down the gap and then up the wall. My crampons have an amazingly good grip on a totally smooth rock face.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Soon we find ourselves amidst a debris of boulders and a road up to some saddle of a mountain. Crampons and rope off, we will just walk up. (Of course this walk doesn’t exactly mean walk, but it is still a safe upward road, with no additional security devices needed, cables being installed through the tougher sections.) Only a hundred meters of altitude difference and we have a more complete, somewhat distant and therefore comprehensive view of the central sections of the glacier and its bend. Breath-taking, exhilarating and challenging. We try to look back to where we have come from, but that is lost somewhere in space. We see however the last one or two kilometre long wandering section of the glacier, the labyrinth we have been in. Thousands of ridges separated by thousands of crevasses, abysses, blue holes to loose yourself in… I feel a sort of self-contempt especially when we shake hands with the group leader and he congratulates us for accomplishing the tough parts without accidents. We thank him on our turn. After all, it was his skills, experience, knowledge of the mountain, instinct of the glacier and above all, attention and patience that dragged us along and across two glaciers in two days. He coils the rope and says nothing. The blueness of a summit-background sky is lost in his eyes, he is thinking of the next trip already...<br/></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Finally, the hardest lesson comes: we are off the glacier, far from the crevasses, gone through the moraine, rock-climbed one of the walls neighbouring the giant body of the glacier, as we gain height on the slope where thousands of boulders of various size were cast by some titan architect, we see more and more of this 900 meters (2700 feet) thick block of ice and snow AND yet the end is beyond our reach... there remains still slope after slope, half-vertical boulder-fields petrified before a fatal fall, then steep rock and then ice-covered rock and then a fresh-snow-covered avalanche field and only far above all these are the ridges, crests and cols connecting summits and high-points of our earth’s noble back.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The journey doesn’t end until it takes toll even on our absolutely last drop of strength, concentration, patience, swiftness and breath. Had it not been for God’s Grace in form of the guide, the map, the crampons, the avalanches that did NOT launch themselves to rush on us, it would be a total failure I have to report. But God’s Grace is somehow there, at the right place, at the right moment. I am prone to believe that this is our last and only chance... Final lesson for today, you may have a rest now, before embarking again.</span></p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Cinque Torri, Punta Fiames...</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>6 June<br/>
The weather was still not getting better and it was again cloudy. We decided to wait again on Punta Fiames route and that day we went on Cinque Torri. We chose two routes and they were located on Torre Barancio which top rises up to 2308m height. The first route that we did was on the North Face and it is called “Dibona”. It is graded IV and it has 4 pitches. The second one is the North-West Corner and it was also graded IV with 3 pitches (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). They were both first climbed by the Dibona/Apollonio/Stefani party in September 1934. The difficulties on the first route were located in the fist half where we climbed through well-polished slabs; the intermittent rain was not helping either. But after that the terrain eased up and I ended the last pitch on the Torre Romana from where we made one 50m abseil. I liked the second route much more. It had a sustained difficulty level and again (like the day before) I moved through a well-sized corner/chimney.</p>

<p class="c3">- Cinque Torri</p>
<p>The chimney is actually in the crack between the two towers, Torre Barancio and Torre Romana - they are connected at the foot but the higher you go they split very visibly as seen from the second route.. When we finished climbing the first route it started raining and I thought that that would be it for that day. But actually the rain eased up and we decided to do a quick climb of the corner no matter how wet we would get. The moment when we started climbing it stopped raining, and the moment I collected the rope after the abseil it started raining again. It was a special moment, if felt like we were somehow rewarded for our decision…</p>
<p>7 June<br/>
The next morning the skies looked clear. They were much clear and bright and we decided to go on Punta Fiames. The mountain is 2240m high, and the route is on its south face called “ Via Comune”. It is a 400m long route with 15 pitches graded IV+ (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). After the approach (which we had researched a few days earlier) we came under the wall and started looking for the real chimney, at the foot of which it was written that the route starts. I think we started out about 3-4 meters to the left but anyway we came to the first belay stance and from there on, the route finding was easy. I was well absorbed in the climbing of the route and at one moment I felt I knew where the first party would have gone the next pitch, my guess turned out to be correct… It was nice climbing and we liked this route very much also. I must admit that I had doubts whether we should start or not since when we arrived the sky was covered with gray clouds and it looked like it would rain again. But we had delayed enough, and it was the second time we had made the approach – I guess we would have never come for a third time so we just started and later the sky cleared up a little. We both like climbing long routes no matter how easy/difficult they are. We like being exposed on a wall for few hours and being concentrated on the climb and on the difficulties that we are passing through. It is a special moment when you come down in the camp and look at the big face again and remembering how you went through the corner, and then the exposed traverse, then chimneys… I don’t know why – it is simply so. From the top of the route there was a short via ferrata (over fixed steel cord) to the summit from where first over a cairn marked path and then just by orientation we came to the gullies that were scree-filled and after 2 hours we were at our car.</p>

<p class="c3">- Punta Fiames</p>
<p>So we did nine routes in eight days during this first visit of ours in the Dolomites. It was a nice experience and we hope to visit this places again very soon since there are so many possibilities in a very vast and real alpine climbing area. We liked it especially because most of the time we were alone and climbing by ourselves in a nice (and sometimes wild) mountain environment was a special experience.</p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Piccolo Lagazuoi, Piz Popena Basso...</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>3 June<br/>
Finding the start of the route called “Via del Buco” on the South-West Face of Piccolo Lagazuoi was a little tricky since I recognized the roof in the third pitch looking up from the base of this wall but I was not sure which corner to take since there were two almost close to each other. While going up and down on the scree gully two older Swiss climbers approached the face and came close where I was standing. They didn’t understand a word English but I just mentioned the name of the route and the leader of the party showed me the right hand corner. (There was an orange piton driven in at the start of the left corner, which got my attention). We were ready to start so we went ahead of them and in the first 2-3 pitches they were following us very close. The leader would come at the belay stance while Vesna was belaying…After that they somehow slowed down since the second climber was going slowly but we waited for them at the top and took a picture with us all together because I was very inspired by watching them still climbing at the ages of 53 and 78.  We had a small chat at the top, using my broken German. They reminded me an interview I read with Anderl Heckmair (the leader of the first ascent party of the North Face of Eiger in 1938). He was then 93 years old and answering the question when did he stop climbing, he said “two years ago (when he was 91) because he had some strange pain in the leg…” The whole interview was very inspiring and something that I never forgot…Anderl Heckamer died on 2 February 2005, 98 years old.</p>

<p class="c3">- On Piccolo Lagazuoi</p>
<p>Looking back on “Via del Buco" - it was very satisfying 250metres long route with 10 pitches with all of the climbing moves in the IV grade area (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). You have corners, slabs, overhang, roof and if not satisfied at the end you can always choose the exit 2 pitches graded V+ in a corner which now was dripping wet. Although in the guidebook it says “abundant protection” I would say that you would never regret taking a rack of nuts, cams and slings wherever you go in the Dolomites since here (and I am not blind) I could only find “abundant possibilities for protection”. There was always good enough crack for a cam or a place to put a sling around… Anyway, if climbing IV is well in your abilities you will enjoy the solid rock and keep climbing through the “hold-covered” route of Piccolo Lagazuoi without being bothered whether there is in-situ protection or you have to put it by your self…For the descent we were not sure about the length of the abseil (it is not written in the book) so we climbed with a single rope and Vesna carried another rope in case the abseil is longer then 25m. But there was no need for abseil at all. There is an excellent system of fixed steel cord and a very solid bridge that got us on the old military path that took us on the approach route.</p>

<p>4 June<br/>
The next day we went to find the approach route for Punta Fiames, the most westerly summit in the Pomagagnon group to the north of Cortina. Punta Fiames is a most awe-inspiring sight entering Cortina by car driving from Belluno. The moment I saw it on the picture in the guidebook, I wanted to do it. However, the day was all cloudy and rainy so it was a nice rest day. We couldn’t climb for sure, but we could hike up and check the approach. We parked the car at the hospital complex driving to Olimpia Camping and from there over the meadow we got on the wide path numbered 211. Bearing leftwards we got into a junction point and followed the path 202 that got us through the pine tree forest to the scree from where another junction and a marked path with regular red/white paint (no numbers on it) leads under the South Face of Punta Fiames… At the moment when I got to the very start of the route after about 2 hours approach it started to rain more heavily and we walked (and scrambled through the upper approach chimneys) back. All we needed was a clear day...</p>
<p><br/>
5 June<br/>
During the night it rained heavily and we didn’t want to climb on a wet 400m high rock that looked slabby… But we didn’t want to lose another day's either so we decided to go towards the Lake Misurina and climb on the nearby Piz Popena Basso. This is a 2224m high mountain where on its East Face we climbed 2 routes. The first one (graded IV+, length 120m) was first climbed by Mazzorana/Adler party on 17 August 1936, and the second one (graded IV, length 130m) was first climbed by Piero Mazzorana on 23 September 1931. They both had 4 pitches. We parked the car on the parking of the Misurina Hotel and after about 45 minutes got under the routes. This was the first time when we met local Italian climbers. It was good that they came after us since 2 parties (5 people) were climbing the first route that we wanted to do and we saw they were still there when we finished it and were at the foot of the wall searching for the start of the second route. Both routes were easy - there was a nice exposed traverse and an easy overhang of IV at the first one. As for the second one, all that I can say is – chimneying. Although the route starts following a corner, my abiding memory is of the chimneys. I really liked them. They were perfectly sized (not too narrow or wide) and climbing at that grade I started to like chimneying again. I found the rock more slippery somehow and there were also a few overhangy slabs and cracks that for a moment made me think that they should perhaps be graded a half-grade more, but it is OK. Good holds – just have to stretch and find them and here there was enough in-situ protection, especially on the crux points. Even knowing this I would advise you to take some slings and nuts, you will at least feel more confident…</p>
