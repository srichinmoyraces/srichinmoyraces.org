            <p class="documentDescription">Climbing in Macedonia</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p><span class="c3">Demir Kapija is an area in South-Central Macedonia about 120 km f</span><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">rom</span> <span class="c4"><tt>Skopje. A journey down the Skopje-Solun (Greece) highway or a railway</tt> <tt>connection will take you to the small settlement of the same name. The</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river Vardar separates the settlement of Demir Kapija from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>the big limestone rockface that rises up right from the left bank of</tt> <tt>the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river (making it hard to approach for climbing). The rock itself is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fragile - like any other limestone but also because it has not been</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed very often – frequent climbing “cleans up” the rock by pushing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down the loose rocks or even blocks, but here in Demir Kapija you could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">till find some dangerous patches, not because of the technical</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ifficulty but because of the potential danger of falling rocks. On the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ther hand, there still remains many possibilities for new routes. The</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span><tt><span class="c3">xisting routes are about 200-250 metres long</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">(d</span><span class="c3">epending where they</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">s</span><tt><span class="c3">tart) and in the IV-VI grading area.</span></tt></p>
<p><span class="c4"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/pristap1" height="167" width="252"/><span class="c4"><img class="c5" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/prist2" height="178" width="263"/></span></span></p>
<p><span class="c4">-The approaches</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>There are two ways to approach the routes - one by climbing up over to</tt></span></p>
<tt><span class="c3">the top and following a marked path that leads down over at times</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>difficult ground, or the second way over the highway.</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">There are two tunnels on the highway (about 500m after the junction for</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the town) and after passing the first one there is a little stream on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the right that goes towards the river where you can find a fixed steel</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cord so that you can traverse towards the routes. Usually we take the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">second approach because it is much faster and safer, but when the river</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is too high, we go around taking the other way. Getting down is easy.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">From the top there is a trail that leads down to the highway and from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>there into the town, but because it is not very well marked we</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">followed</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the ridge which then met up with the trail - from there on it was easy.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<tt>With Vesna</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">we</span> <span class="c3">have climbed 4 routes in this area - Tulumba,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Polzav, Slavkova and Blazeva. Vesna also has climbed the route Vlatceva</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with another climber. Tulumba and Polzav are two of the longest</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">existing routes. They start close to each other and have a common exit</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">– they share the last pitch. The grades in these routes are up to V but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">they are concentrated mainly in the first two pitches and in the last</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">one. The last third of the first pitch of Tulumba has one overhang</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which I passed using one little rock that was stuck in the wide crack</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cutting the upper part of the overhang in half. Usually when you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climb on</span> <span class="c3">harder rocks these moves give you real joy because of their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">unusual quality, but not here - climbing in such a fragile environment</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made me feel a little queasy about having to use this kind of handhold.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>But this was the only way, so first I put a sling around the rock for</tt> <tt>protection and after that I grabbed the rock, pulled on it, and moved</tt> <tt>on as quickly as I could. The first pitch on Polzav also finds you</tt> <tt>under a small overhang. I had to combine</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the handholds for my left hand on the overhang with the slab on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right where there were no good footholds at all - I had to climb using</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friction moves and</span> <span class="c3">reaching with my left hand as far as I could over</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the overhang. In both cases it was a real relief when I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">out of it. There were good belay stances above and I secured Vesna –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">she came out of these</span> <span class="c3">“problems” with a smile on her face since she</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could enjoy climbing concentrated only on the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and not worrying about holding on loose pieces of rock. The middle two</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches are easy III scrambling. The routes (like all the others here)</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">do not</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>have enough protection “in situ”, so climbing here means having your</tt> <tt>cams, nuts, slings and pitons prepared. The hardest moves in the routes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">are “clean” – the rock here is not (very) fragile so we were free to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">concentrate only on the moves. It is where the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">are</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">not as high that the terrain and the rock gets more fragile – but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that’s also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">part of the climbing… Vlatceva starts also close to these routes but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">has a more straight line and ends up also more to the right. When you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">look at the rock from the other side of the river the line of the route</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(few meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the right of Tulumba) is visible, following wide and narrow cracks</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">up the rockface…</span></tt>

<p>-Pozav(left) and Tulumba (right)</p>
<p><br/>
<tt>Slavkova is a shorter route that starts somewhere on the half of the</tt> <tt>rock, but much harder and here the crux reaches up to VI+ grade. The</tt> <tt>line of the route is far from “diretissima” - it just starts and goes</tt> <tt>up fearlessly towards the hardest technical</tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulties that are in its way. After some easy scrambling from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">river bank we got under the route which starts following a dehidre and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ends up few meters under the overhangs.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">The first belay stance is actually at the tree on the top of this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">dehidre after which the route goes up the slab and traverse to the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right. After this there is a line that will get you right under the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first overhang. Here the climbers feel (and are) very exposed. The hand</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and foot holds are such a position that we had to move almost lying</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">bodies horizontally in the air, turned sideways on the rock and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stretching over as far as we could to the right. The overhanging area</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is so big that when climbers move through the first overhang they can</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see the ground 200 meters under their legs … The first overhang can be</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed following a crack that moves diagonally to the right towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the second overhang. We made the second belay stance under the second</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhang because there was a drag on the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and I just couldn’t move through something this difficult pulling up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with my hand or body. The correct line goes straight up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the second overhand, but if you want to climb it free without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">using the pitons</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“in situ” for aid climbing but you can’t because it’s just not your</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day, you can go around to the right. We didn’t do this - but I must say</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that I was not successful passing this overhang from the first try</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(even second, third…:) There is enough protection “in situ” through the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhangs and in the area over and under them, but not enough in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first pitch where we used the crack that we followed that is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cam-friendly.</span></tt></p>

<p>-Slavkova route and climbers under the second overhang<br/>
<br/>
<tt>Blazeva is easy long route where the crux of grade VI is in the last</tt> <tt>7-8 meters where the route gets a little overhangy. For a route of</tt> <tt>around</tt> <tt><span class="c3">250</span> <span class="c3">metres this means pleasant long climb with beautiful views over the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridges that this route follows. The start is over an easy and wide</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">chimney (IV+/V) with lot of possibilities for putting cams and slings.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">But the rock here is more fragile and I had to be very careful how I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was climbing and what I was holding to because everything that would</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">brake would fall directly down on Vesna through the chimney where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">her belay stance was. After the first pitch there are two or three easy</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of easy II/III scrambling. Here we moved parallel and when we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">got at the point where the route gets more vertical we made the belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stance. From here on it gets a little harder but the rock was very</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hospitable for belay means. The last (very short) pitch has a grade VI</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and it starts on a big terrace where we enjoyed the views on the both</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sides of the canyon. The name “Demir Kapija” actually means “Iron</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Gate”. The canyon is like a gate from one valley to another so being on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a top or close gives you unique opportunity to see how the river curves</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the valleys on the both sides. The last pitch can be also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed by another</span> <span class="c3">variation that goes a little towards to the left</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">where we found big handholds and big cracks for cams (I could see a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">old and rusty pitons on my right that were from the harder variation).</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">These were the only “in situ” protection that we saw in this route.</span></tt></p>
<p><tt><span class="c3"><img class="c10" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/blaz" height="142" width="282"/><span class="c4"><img class="c11" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/abz" height="209" width="287"/></span></span></tt></p>
<p><span class="c4">-The upper part of Blazeva</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>The Demir Kapija area is one of the hottest places in Macedonia (if</tt> <tt>not the hottest), so usually we don’t climb here during the summer</tt> <tt>period. The rock faces south so during the whole day</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">climbers are exposed under the sun and climbing on temperatures high</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">over 40 degrees Centigrade can be very exhausting… Still between the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tunnels, there is enough protection and shade and there are some short</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sport-climbing routes that can be done if it is really hot. There are</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>good places for putting up a tent near the small stream that also</tt> <tt>passes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">through</span> <span class="c3">here.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This was the place where, 7 years ago, I began climbing unprotected big</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">routes and I had to plan the route all by myself. I remember during</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first climb I was so concentrated</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on what I was doing while climbing that I only started noticing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">surroundings after reaching the upper half of the route. During</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first hour or two of climbing I couldn’t see anything else around</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only the gray rock, the forms on it, cracks, hand and footholds - I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">so concentrated climbing and protecting my climbing partner that it was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only after some time that I started seeing the valley. It was like</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being awakened from sleep - looking at the surrounding</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">environment, the river that was passing down there, the train, the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">town. It was like the picture was slowly getting filled piece by piece.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was amazed by this effortless concentration that climbing got me in…</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">In few books written by climbers I’ve read how they compare this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">activity with meditation. Meditation, like climbing, gives you a rare</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">opportunity to analyze</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">yourself and go deep and find your limitations and go over them. I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">remember a quote from one climber (unfortunately I can’t remember who</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that) who said that only when we will climb the mountains that are in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ourselves, the mountains of jealousy, fear, anxiety, only then we will</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">be on the highest mountain of the world…</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This is what <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> says about concentration and meditation:</tt></span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><tt>“…Concentration is the open secret of focusing all one’s attention on</tt> <tt>a particular object or person in order to enter into and have one’s</tt> <tt>identification with that object or person. The final stage of</tt> <tt>concentration is to discover and reveal the hidden ultimate Truth in</tt> <tt>the object of concentration. What concentration can do in our</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">day-to-day life is unimaginable. It most easily separates our heart’s</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Heaven from our mind’s hell so that we can live the constant delight</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and joy of Heaven and not in the perpetual worries, anxieties and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tortures of hell while we are on earth…”</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>“Meditation is man’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering. When</tt> <tt>men’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering meet together man becomes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">immortal in the inner world and God becomes fulfilled in the outer</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">world…It is only through meditation that we can get lasting peace,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">divine peace. If we can meditate soulfully in the morning and receive</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">peace for only one minute, that one minute of peace will permeate our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">whole day…We need meditation because we want to grow in Light and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fulfill ourselves in Light…”</span></tt></p>

<p>Question: If your goal is to run fifty miles per week, is it better to run seven miles a day or to vary the distance?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is always good to have easy and hard days. It is best to have two easy days and then one hard day. Even having alternate easy and hard days is not good enough. If you run fifteen miles one day, it is not good to run seven or ten miles the next day. Instead, on your hard days cover twenty or twenty-five miles or even a full marathon. Then take two easy days. In this way, you can cover seventy or eighty miles a week.</p>
<p>Only those who are very strong and who are seriously training for long-distance running should do more than seventy miles a week. They can run one hundred miles or one hundred twenty miles.</p>
<p>Question: How much importance should we give to physical exercise in comparison to our regular work?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: You are working very hard at your business, but you are thinking that that is the only work you have to do. You are giving one hundred per cent of your attention to your business and not even one per cent to your body. You have to feel that the body is also something necessary. So when you are here taking exercise or practising sports, you have to think that this is the only thing in your life. Otherwise, while you are practising sports you will still be thinking of your business. If you give importance to sport, you will get extra energy from it for your work.</p>
<p>Question: How do you feel about bicycle training to improve running?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: I did a great deal of bicycling when I lived in India in my youth. For at least two and a half hours every day I used to cycle as I did errands. It does not increase running speed at all, but something is better than nothing. Sometimes cycling can actually be a hindrance to running speed, because it develops special kinds of muscles which do not complement the speed muscles. Bicycling does help for endurance, but if you want to increase your running speed, then I don't advise it. You can cycle for endurance, or if you are injured and cannot run. For a little bit of stamina you can do it. But again, cycling stamina is totally different from running stamina. If one wants to become a good runner and maintain a five-minute pace, then cycling is not the answer. Quality road work is the answer.</p>
<p>Question: What is a good exercise to strengthen the legs when they get tired from standing all day?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If your legs get tired from standing all day, there are two exercises that are very good to strengthen them. One exercise develops the knee muscles. You sit on the floor with one leg straight, and the other leg bent with the knee up, both hands on your hips. Then you switch, bending the straight leg and straightening the bent leg. Then keep switching.</p>
<p>The other exercise is to do a deep knee bend on one leg, with the other leg out in front of you, and then stand up again, still keeping one leg in front of you. First you do it with a flat foot, then on your toe. If you can do it three or four times, your legs will have tremendous strength from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Question: Do people really need more sleep when they are training for athletics?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: For ordinary people, it is true. If they run a few miles, they need more sleep. But for spiritual people, especially advanced seekers, it is not necessary. By drawing down cosmic energy, in two minutes they can get the rest of two hours, three hours, four hours. It depends on how effectively you can draw in cosmic energy. But ordinary runners do have to sleep longer.</p>
<p>Question: What time of day is best to run?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It depends on the individual runner. Whenever the individual feels most physically fit, most vitally fit, most mentally fit and most psychically fit is the best time for that individual to run.</p>
<p>Running makes the body young. Striving makes the vital young. Smiling makes the mind young. Serving makes the heart young. Loving makes the soul young.</p>

<p>Question: I find that sometimes I go through a period of making very good progress in sport; and then after some time everything falls apart and my training goes downhill.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It happens to everyone. Life is not always smooth sailing; it goes up and down. The main thing is to get satisfaction. In sport, when you touch a peak you are very happy. When you are unable to reach your peak, you should not feel that it is your fault. It is not that you have deliberately injured yourself. You have not said to your body, "I fed you so many times; now I want to starve you." If you are deliberately enjoying your lack of speed or lack of enthusiasm, then you are to be blamed. But if circumstances have led you to this condition, please try to maintain your equanimity and peace of mind. Feel that you are going through a phase that may last for three or four weeks, but that eventually it will pass. Try to think of the summit which you reached two or three weeks earlier, and try to remember the joy that you felt. Then you will see that the joy you got from your previous achievements will carry you through, and very soon you will not only reach but transcend your previous height. You are not fooling yourself; you are only bringing happiness into your system, and this happiness is confidence. Again, confidence itself is happiness.</p>
<p>Try to feel that your problem is just a small obstacle, a hurdle that you will soon overcome. Then you will be able to diminish the frustration that you now feel. Once you diminish your frustration, again in a week or so you will be able to regain your capacity. But if you maintain or increase your frustration, then the problem will linger. It may go on for two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Question: Always when I become very interested in the physical and playing sports, I injure myself to the point where I have to stop completely. Why does this happen?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: What actually happens in your case is that when you enter into the physical world - playing tennis or other things - you do not give value to the physical as such. You remain in the mind. A portion of your existence you throw into the game and another portion you keep totally in the mind-world. It is like cutting yourself in half. You are keeping your body on the first floor, but your consciousness is always on the upper floor, in the mind. If you can direct more of your mental energy into the physical when you play, this will not happen. You want to play; you want to win. But actually the concentration of the mind, the real concentration, is not in the physical itself. You know that you are playing tennis, but the concentration that the body needs from the mind is not there. There is a gap. The body without concentration from the mind is helpless. So, when you play, do not think of your mental work. Your mind may not be aware that it is thinking of the wrong thing, but it is one thing not to be aware of doing the wrong thing and another thing to concentrate consciously on the right thing. Inside you and all around you there are many beings. Because there is a gap between the mind's concentration and the physical activity, these beings can attack the physical. They need not actually be wrong forces, but they may create unfortunate experiences in life.</p>
<p>Question: How can running help me overcome my spiritual weaknesses and impurities?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: While you are running - especially when you are tired - you are much more conscious of your breathing. You are more aware of when you are inhaling and when you are exhaling. While running, when you inhale, you can consciously invoke divine energy to energize you. This divine energy energizes the willing reality in you and illumines the unlit reality in you so that you can become a perfect instrument of God. When you breathe in the divine energy, automatically it changes or transforms undivine forces into divine forces.</p>
<p>Each time you breathe in, if you can repeat just one time God's Name, or 'Supreme', or whatever divine name or form comes to mind, then that spiritual thought will increase your purity. Either it turns into purity within you or it grants purity to you. Then, when you breathe out, feel that a new eagerness and a new promise are going out from you to the Universal Consciousness. This new promise is nothing short of your sincere willingness and eagerness to become a good and perfect instrument of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Question: Should we run even when we are extremely tired?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: As a rule, when we are extremely tired it is not advisable to run, for it will not help us in any way. At that time, running will be nothing but fatigue and self-destruction, and it will leave in our mind a bitter taste. But sometimes, even when we are not extremely tired, we feel that we are. At that time we are not actually physically tired. We are only mentally tired or emotionally tired, but the mind convinces us that we are physically tired. Our human lethargy is so clever! It acts like a rogue, a perfect rogue, and we get tremendous joy by offering compassion to our body. We make all kinds of justifications for the body's lethargy and make ourselves feel that the body deserves rest.</p>
<p>So we have to be sincere to ourselves. If we really feel extremely tired, then we should not run. But we have to make sure that it is not our lethargic mind, our lethargic vital or our lethargic physical consciousness that is making us feel that we are extremely tired. This kind of tricky cleverness we have to conquer.</p>
<p>With our imagination-power we can challenge the tricky mind and win. We weaken ourselves by imagining that we are weak. Again, we can strengthen ourselves by imagining that we are strong. Our imagination often compels us to think we cannot do something or cannot say something. We often use imagination in a wrong direction. So instead of letting imagination take us backwards, we should use it to take us forward toward our goal.</p>
<p>Question: How do you run through inner pain?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: Inner pain is a joke. Outer pain I believe in. Sometimes I can't place my foot on the ground without getting such pain! But inner pain, which comes from frustration, depression, jealousy and insecurity, is a joke. Inner pain should be discarded like a filthy rag! Outer pain you cannot so easily ignore, but inner pain must be discarded.</p>
<p>If you have inner pain, if you are jealous of someone or are in an undivine consciousness, then the outer running will actually help you. When you are running and perspiring, when you are struggling, at that time the inner pain goes away to some extent. Otherwise, if because you are depressed you don't go out to run, then you are just a fool. If you feel depressed while you are running, you can sing loudly and deliberately try to sing wrong notes. Then laugh at yourself. Some of my friends used to do this. They were good singers, but deliberately they would sing wrong notes while they were walking, and it would make them laugh. In that way they got rid of depression.</p>
<p>Question: If one is in generally good health, what would cause pain and aches in the body?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is one thing to have good health and another thing to deliberately maintain good health. Unless you are consciously keeping good health, at any moment you may be attacked by some forces. It is like having a large amount of money without knowing about it. If you are not conscious of it, you may easily lose it. If you are not conscious that you have a flower, you are likely to lose it. Anything that you have must have some place in your awareness. You may have good physical health, but perhaps in two months' time you have not thought of your body once, let alone tried to increase the strength of your legs or arms or to get some extra capacity.</p>
<p>Unless you touch something every day, it does not shine. Often I have told people to touch the furniture in their homes every day. As soon as you touch something, it gets new life. If you are aware of something, immediately it shines and gets a new luminosity. If you have good health, if you touch your health every day, it gets new life. By giving attention to something, you give new life to it.</p>
<p>Question: When I run I sometimes get a slight knee pain. Should I stop running at that time?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If you get just a slight pain in your knee, and if the pain is bearable, then you should continue running. At that time, feel that if you run a hundred metres more, the pain will go away. Then, after you have covered a hundred metres, feel that the pain will definitely stop if you run another hundred metres. If you do this five or six times, then most of the pain will go away. Even if some pain remains, the mind has already taken away your awareness from it. Your mind has forgotten about it. But if the pain is absolutely unbearable, what can you do? You simply have to surrender to it and stop running, at least for a while.</p>
<p>Question: How can we spiritually heal injuries?</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: It is a matter of inner capacity. One kind of capacity is to heal the injury by bringing down peace and light from above. Another kind of capacity is to ignore the pain altogether. During your meditation, if all of a sudden you have intense aspiration, then you can bring down more light from above to cure your injury. But you have to do this consciously during your meditation. If during the day you casually say, "Oh, how I wish I didn't have any pain!" that will be useless. But while you are meditating, if you suddenly remember your pain, that is the time to pray and bring down more light.</p>
<p>Again, you can increase your capacity to tolerate pain. Now you have pain, let us say, but still you run; whereas if you had had the same kind of pain four years ago perhaps you would not have been able to run. Again, sometimes the pain is unbearable and it is absolutely impossible to run. Then what can you do? But if it is bearable, try to run according to your own capacity. At that time, don't think of how fast this person or that person is running. Just go according to your own capacity and remain cheerful. All the time think that you are running only against yourself. Again, if it is beyond your capacity to ignore the pain, in addition to praying and meditating, you can also go to the outer doctor. Light is also inside the doctor.</p>
<p>Question: Sometimes I feel pain in my foot, and I start worrying that if I keep running, I might get a stress fracture. This happens even if the pain is not that bad and I know that probably nothing will happen.</p>
<p>Sri Chinmoy: If it is unbearable, excruciating pain, then something serious might happen. But if there is just a tiny pain in your foot, this kind of fear is only false anxiety that is coming to your mind. If you are worried, you can take rest for a few days and see if the pain goes away. If it leaves in just a day or two, you will know that it was nothing serious. In this way you will become more confident that nothing will happen to your foot if you run.</p>
<p>So if the pain is not that serious, you do not have to worry. Your foot is not going to give out. It is only that fear has entered into your mind, and the mind has created false anxiety in you, a false alarm. You should not cherish these fears.</p>
<p>Morning running is purity's beauty. Evening running is simplicity's luminosity.</p>
<p>Don't take a late start. You may lose the race altogether. Keep your love-devotion-surrender Always on the alert. Then you cannot have a late start.</p>
<p>Run! You can easily challenge The pride of frightening distance.</p>
