            <p class="documentDescription">Climbing in Macedonia</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p><span class="c3">Demir Kapija is an area in South-Central Macedonia about 120 km f</span><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">rom</span> <span class="c4"><tt>Skopje. A journey down the Skopje-Solun (Greece) highway or a railway</tt> <tt>connection will take you to the small settlement of the same name. The</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river Vardar separates the settlement of Demir Kapija from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>the big limestone rockface that rises up right from the left bank of</tt> <tt>the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">river (making it hard to approach for climbing). The rock itself is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fragile - like any other limestone but also because it has not been</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed very often – frequent climbing “cleans up” the rock by pushing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down the loose rocks or even blocks, but here in Demir Kapija you could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">till find some dangerous patches, not because of the technical</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ifficulty but because of the potential danger of falling rocks. On the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ther hand, there still remains many possibilities for new routes. The</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span><tt><span class="c3">xisting routes are about 200-250 metres long</span> <span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">(d</span><span class="c3">epending where they</span></tt> <span class="c4" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">s</span><tt><span class="c3">tart) and in the IV-VI grading area.</span></tt></p>
<p><span class="c4"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/pristap1" height="167" width="252"/><span class="c4"><img class="c5" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/prist2" height="178" width="263"/></span></span></p>
<p><span class="c4">-The approaches</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>There are two ways to approach the routes - one by climbing up over to</tt></span></p>
<tt><span class="c3">the top and following a marked path that leads down over at times</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>difficult ground, or the second way over the highway.</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">There are two tunnels on the highway (about 500m after the junction for</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the town) and after passing the first one there is a little stream on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the right that goes towards the river where you can find a fixed steel</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cord so that you can traverse towards the routes. Usually we take the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">second approach because it is much faster and safer, but when the river</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is too high, we go around taking the other way. Getting down is easy.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">From the top there is a trail that leads down to the highway and from</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>there into the town, but because it is not very well marked we</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">followed</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the ridge which then met up with the trail - from there on it was easy.</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<tt>With Vesna</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">we</span> <span class="c3">have climbed 4 routes in this area - Tulumba,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Polzav, Slavkova and Blazeva. Vesna also has climbed the route Vlatceva</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with another climber. Tulumba and Polzav are two of the longest</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">existing routes. They start close to each other and have a common exit</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">– they share the last pitch. The grades in these routes are up to V but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">they are concentrated mainly in the first two pitches and in the last</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">one. The last third of the first pitch of Tulumba has one overhang</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which I passed using one little rock that was stuck in the wide crack</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cutting the upper part of the overhang in half. Usually when you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climb on</span> <span class="c3">harder rocks these moves give you real joy because of their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">unusual quality, but not here - climbing in such a fragile environment</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made me feel a little queasy about having to use this kind of handhold.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>But this was the only way, so first I put a sling around the rock for</tt> <tt>protection and after that I grabbed the rock, pulled on it, and moved</tt> <tt>on as quickly as I could. The first pitch on Polzav also finds you</tt> <tt>under a small overhang. I had to combine</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">the handholds for my left hand on the overhang with the slab on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right where there were no good footholds at all - I had to climb using</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friction moves and</span> <span class="c3">reaching with my left hand as far as I could over</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the overhang. In both cases it was a real relief when I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">out of it. There were good belay stances above and I secured Vesna –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">she came out of these</span> <span class="c3">“problems” with a smile on her face since she</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could enjoy climbing concentrated only on the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and not worrying about holding on loose pieces of rock. The middle two</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches are easy III scrambling. The routes (like all the others here)</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">do not</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>have enough protection “in situ”, so climbing here means having your</tt> <tt>cams, nuts, slings and pitons prepared. The hardest moves in the routes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">are “clean” – the rock here is not (very) fragile so we were free to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">concentrate only on the moves. It is where the technical difficulties</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">are</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">not as high that the terrain and the rock gets more fragile – but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that’s also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">part of the climbing… Vlatceva starts also close to these routes but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">has a more straight line and ends up also more to the right. When you</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">look at the rock from the other side of the river the line of the route</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(few meters</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on the right of Tulumba) is visible, following wide and narrow cracks</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">up the rockface…</span></tt>

<p>-Pozav(left) and Tulumba (right)</p>
<p><br/>
<tt>Slavkova is a shorter route that starts somewhere on the half of the</tt> <tt>rock, but much harder and here the crux reaches up to VI+ grade. The</tt> <tt>line of the route is far from “diretissima” - it just starts and goes</tt> <tt>up fearlessly towards the hardest technical</tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulties that are in its way. After some easy scrambling from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">river bank we got under the route which starts following a dehidre and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ends up few meters under the overhangs.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">The first belay stance is actually at the tree on the top of this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">dehidre after which the route goes up the slab and traverse to the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">right. After this there is a line that will get you right under the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first overhang. Here the climbers feel (and are) very exposed. The hand</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and foot holds are such a position that we had to move almost lying</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">bodies horizontally in the air, turned sideways on the rock and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stretching over as far as we could to the right. The overhanging area</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">is so big that when climbers move through the first overhang they can</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see the ground 200 meters under their legs … The first overhang can be</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed following a crack that moves diagonally to the right towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the second overhang. We made the second belay stance under the second</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhang because there was a drag on the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and I just couldn’t move through something this difficult pulling up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the rope</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">with my hand or body. The correct line goes straight up</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the second overhand, but if you want to climb it free without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">using the pitons</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“in situ” for aid climbing but you can’t because it’s just not your</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">day, you can go around to the right. We didn’t do this - but I must say</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that I was not successful passing this overhang from the first try</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(even second, third…:) There is enough protection “in situ” through the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overhangs and in the area over and under them, but not enough in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">first pitch where we used the crack that we followed that is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cam-friendly.</span></tt></p>

<p>-Slavkova route and climbers under the second overhang<br/>
<br/>
<tt>Blazeva is easy long route where the crux of grade VI is in the last</tt> <tt>7-8 meters where the route gets a little overhangy. For a route of</tt> <tt>around</tt> <tt><span class="c3">250</span> <span class="c3">metres this means pleasant long climb with beautiful views over the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridges that this route follows. The start is over an easy and wide</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">chimney (IV+/V) with lot of possibilities for putting cams and slings.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">But the rock here is more fragile and I had to be very careful how I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was climbing and what I was holding to because everything that would</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">brake would fall directly down on Vesna through the chimney where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">her belay stance was. After the first pitch there are two or three easy</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of easy II/III scrambling. Here we moved parallel and when we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">got at the point where the route gets more vertical we made the belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stance. From here on it gets a little harder but the rock was very</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hospitable for belay means. The last (very short) pitch has a grade VI</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and it starts on a big terrace where we enjoyed the views on the both</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sides of the canyon. The name “Demir Kapija” actually means “Iron</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Gate”. The canyon is like a gate from one valley to another so being on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a top or close gives you unique opportunity to see how the river curves</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">through the valleys on the both sides. The last pitch can be also</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed by another</span> <span class="c3">variation that goes a little towards to the left</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">where we found big handholds and big cracks for cams (I could see a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">old and rusty pitons on my right that were from the harder variation).</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">These were the only “in situ” protection that we saw in this route.</span></tt></p>

<p><span class="c4">-The upper part of Blazeva</span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><br/>
<tt>The Demir Kapija area is one of the hottest places in Macedonia (if</tt> <tt>not the hottest), so usually we don’t climb here during the summer</tt> <tt>period. The rock faces south so during the whole day</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">climbers are exposed under the sun and climbing on temperatures high</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">over 40 degrees Centigrade can be very exhausting… Still between the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tunnels, there is enough protection and shade and there are some short</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sport-climbing routes that can be done if it is really hot. There are</span></tt> <span class="c4"><tt>good places for putting up a tent near the small stream that also</tt> <tt>passes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">through</span> <span class="c3">here.</span></tt> <span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This was the place where, 7 years ago, I began climbing unprotected big</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">routes and I had to plan the route all by myself. I remember during</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first climb I was so concentrated</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on what I was doing while climbing that I only started noticing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">surroundings after reaching the upper half of the route. During</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that first hour or two of climbing I couldn’t see anything else around</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only the gray rock, the forms on it, cracks, hand and footholds - I was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">so concentrated climbing and protecting my climbing partner that it was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only after some time that I started seeing the valley. It was like</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being awakened from sleep - looking at the surrounding</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">environment, the river that was passing down there, the train, the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">town. It was like the picture was slowly getting filled piece by piece.</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was amazed by this effortless concentration that climbing got me in…</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">In few books written by climbers I’ve read how they compare this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">activity with meditation. Meditation, like climbing, gives you a rare</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">opportunity to analyze</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">yourself and go deep and find your limitations and go over them. I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">remember a quote from one climber (unfortunately I can’t remember who</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that) who said that only when we will climb the mountains that are in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ourselves, the mountains of jealousy, fear, anxiety, only then we will</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">be on the highest mountain of the world…</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>This is what <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> says about concentration and meditation:</tt></span></p>
<p><span class="c4"><tt>“…Concentration is the open secret of focusing all one’s attention on</tt> <tt>a particular object or person in order to enter into and have one’s</tt> <tt>identification with that object or person. The final stage of</tt> <tt>concentration is to discover and reveal the hidden ultimate Truth in</tt> <tt>the object of concentration. What concentration can do in our</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">day-to-day life is unimaginable. It most easily separates our heart’s</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Heaven from our mind’s hell so that we can live the constant delight</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">and joy of Heaven and not in the perpetual worries, anxieties and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">tortures of hell while we are on earth…”</span></tt><span class="c4"><br/>
<br/>
<tt>“Meditation is man’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering. When</tt> <tt>men’s self-awakening and God’s Self-Offering meet together man becomes</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">immortal in the inner world and God becomes fulfilled in the outer</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">world…It is only through meditation that we can get lasting peace,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">divine peace. If we can meditate soulfully in the morning and receive</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">peace for only one minute, that one minute of peace will permeate our</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">whole day…We need meditation because we want to grow in Light and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fulfill ourselves in Light…”</span></tt></p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Cinque Torri, Punta Fiames...</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>6 June<br/>
The weather was still not getting better and it was again cloudy. We decided to wait again on Punta Fiames route and that day we went on Cinque Torri. We chose two routes and they were located on Torre Barancio which top rises up to 2308m height. The first route that we did was on the North Face and it is called “Dibona”. It is graded IV and it has 4 pitches. The second one is the North-West Corner and it was also graded IV with 3 pitches (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). They were both first climbed by the Dibona/Apollonio/Stefani party in September 1934. The difficulties on the first route were located in the fist half where we climbed through well-polished slabs; the intermittent rain was not helping either. But after that the terrain eased up and I ended the last pitch on the Torre Romana from where we made one 50m abseil. I liked the second route much more. It had a sustained difficulty level and again (like the day before) I moved through a well-sized corner/chimney.</p>

<p class="c3">- Cinque Torri</p>
<p>The chimney is actually in the crack between the two towers, Torre Barancio and Torre Romana - they are connected at the foot but the higher you go they split very visibly as seen from the second route.. When we finished climbing the first route it started raining and I thought that that would be it for that day. But actually the rain eased up and we decided to do a quick climb of the corner no matter how wet we would get. The moment when we started climbing it stopped raining, and the moment I collected the rope after the abseil it started raining again. It was a special moment, if felt like we were somehow rewarded for our decision…</p>
<p>7 June<br/>
The next morning the skies looked clear. They were much clear and bright and we decided to go on Punta Fiames. The mountain is 2240m high, and the route is on its south face called “ Via Comune”. It is a 400m long route with 15 pitches graded IV+ (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). After the approach (which we had researched a few days earlier) we came under the wall and started looking for the real chimney, at the foot of which it was written that the route starts. I think we started out about 3-4 meters to the left but anyway we came to the first belay stance and from there on, the route finding was easy. I was well absorbed in the climbing of the route and at one moment I felt I knew where the first party would have gone the next pitch, my guess turned out to be correct… It was nice climbing and we liked this route very much also. I must admit that I had doubts whether we should start or not since when we arrived the sky was covered with gray clouds and it looked like it would rain again. But we had delayed enough, and it was the second time we had made the approach – I guess we would have never come for a third time so we just started and later the sky cleared up a little. We both like climbing long routes no matter how easy/difficult they are. We like being exposed on a wall for few hours and being concentrated on the climb and on the difficulties that we are passing through. It is a special moment when you come down in the camp and look at the big face again and remembering how you went through the corner, and then the exposed traverse, then chimneys… I don’t know why – it is simply so. From the top of the route there was a short via ferrata (over fixed steel cord) to the summit from where first over a cairn marked path and then just by orientation we came to the gullies that were scree-filled and after 2 hours we were at our car.</p>

<p class="c3">- Punta Fiames</p>
<p>So we did nine routes in eight days during this first visit of ours in the Dolomites. It was a nice experience and we hope to visit this places again very soon since there are so many possibilities in a very vast and real alpine climbing area. We liked it especially because most of the time we were alone and climbing by ourselves in a nice (and sometimes wild) mountain environment was a special experience.</p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Piccolo Lagazuoi, Piz Popena Basso...</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>3 June<br/>
Finding the start of the route called “Via del Buco” on the South-West Face of Piccolo Lagazuoi was a little tricky since I recognized the roof in the third pitch looking up from the base of this wall but I was not sure which corner to take since there were two almost close to each other. While going up and down on the scree gully two older Swiss climbers approached the face and came close where I was standing. They didn’t understand a word English but I just mentioned the name of the route and the leader of the party showed me the right hand corner. (There was an orange piton driven in at the start of the left corner, which got my attention). We were ready to start so we went ahead of them and in the first 2-3 pitches they were following us very close. The leader would come at the belay stance while Vesna was belaying…After that they somehow slowed down since the second climber was going slowly but we waited for them at the top and took a picture with us all together because I was very inspired by watching them still climbing at the ages of 53 and 78.  We had a small chat at the top, using my broken German. They reminded me an interview I read with Anderl Heckmair (the leader of the first ascent party of the North Face of Eiger in 1938). He was then 93 years old and answering the question when did he stop climbing, he said “two years ago (when he was 91) because he had some strange pain in the leg…” The whole interview was very inspiring and something that I never forgot…Anderl Heckamer died on 2 February 2005, 98 years old.</p>

<p class="c3">- On Piccolo Lagazuoi</p>
<p>Looking back on “Via del Buco" - it was very satisfying 250metres long route with 10 pitches with all of the climbing moves in the IV grade area (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). You have corners, slabs, overhang, roof and if not satisfied at the end you can always choose the exit 2 pitches graded V+ in a corner which now was dripping wet. Although in the guidebook it says “abundant protection” I would say that you would never regret taking a rack of nuts, cams and slings wherever you go in the Dolomites since here (and I am not blind) I could only find “abundant possibilities for protection”. There was always good enough crack for a cam or a place to put a sling around… Anyway, if climbing IV is well in your abilities you will enjoy the solid rock and keep climbing through the “hold-covered” route of Piccolo Lagazuoi without being bothered whether there is in-situ protection or you have to put it by your self…For the descent we were not sure about the length of the abseil (it is not written in the book) so we climbed with a single rope and Vesna carried another rope in case the abseil is longer then 25m. But there was no need for abseil at all. There is an excellent system of fixed steel cord and a very solid bridge that got us on the old military path that took us on the approach route.</p>

<p>4 June<br/>
The next day we went to find the approach route for Punta Fiames, the most westerly summit in the Pomagagnon group to the north of Cortina. Punta Fiames is a most awe-inspiring sight entering Cortina by car driving from Belluno. The moment I saw it on the picture in the guidebook, I wanted to do it. However, the day was all cloudy and rainy so it was a nice rest day. We couldn’t climb for sure, but we could hike up and check the approach. We parked the car at the hospital complex driving to Olimpia Camping and from there over the meadow we got on the wide path numbered 211. Bearing leftwards we got into a junction point and followed the path 202 that got us through the pine tree forest to the scree from where another junction and a marked path with regular red/white paint (no numbers on it) leads under the South Face of Punta Fiames… At the moment when I got to the very start of the route after about 2 hours approach it started to rain more heavily and we walked (and scrambled through the upper approach chimneys) back. All we needed was a clear day...</p>
<p><br/>
5 June<br/>
During the night it rained heavily and we didn’t want to climb on a wet 400m high rock that looked slabby… But we didn’t want to lose another day's either so we decided to go towards the Lake Misurina and climb on the nearby Piz Popena Basso. This is a 2224m high mountain where on its East Face we climbed 2 routes. The first one (graded IV+, length 120m) was first climbed by Mazzorana/Adler party on 17 August 1936, and the second one (graded IV, length 130m) was first climbed by Piero Mazzorana on 23 September 1931. They both had 4 pitches. We parked the car on the parking of the Misurina Hotel and after about 45 minutes got under the routes. This was the first time when we met local Italian climbers. It was good that they came after us since 2 parties (5 people) were climbing the first route that we wanted to do and we saw they were still there when we finished it and were at the foot of the wall searching for the start of the second route. Both routes were easy - there was a nice exposed traverse and an easy overhang of IV at the first one. As for the second one, all that I can say is – chimneying. Although the route starts following a corner, my abiding memory is of the chimneys. I really liked them. They were perfectly sized (not too narrow or wide) and climbing at that grade I started to like chimneying again. I found the rock more slippery somehow and there were also a few overhangy slabs and cracks that for a moment made me think that they should perhaps be graded a half-grade more, but it is OK. Good holds – just have to stretch and find them and here there was enough in-situ protection, especially on the crux points. Even knowing this I would advise you to take some slings and nuts, you will at least feel more confident…</p>
