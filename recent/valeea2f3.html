<meta name="description" content="A SHORT VISIT... After a long journey from our native Macedonia, together with my wife Vesna, we reached the French town of Chamonix. We really felt at home in this most beautiful town; everything in the town breathes with the breath of the mountains: climbing (people moving down-town with backpacks and harnesses on with equipment and still roped up together),mountain-biking (we had few times very close encounter with bikers dressed up like robocops – passing by on a narrow trail with lightning speed), hiking, paragliding… On some houses there were paintings with climbing motifs on, even in the cinema there were two movies about climbing. It was amazing.     - In Chamonix Not having much time however, we decided to go to the mountains the very next day. In the morning we sorted out our gear, calculating what route we would do and how much we should take in our backpacks without overloading them, before heading towards the Aiguille du Midi Teleferique Station. After a fascinating ride which took in a view towards the north face of this needlelike mountain where we could see all the fine details of it, we arrived at the tunnels on the top with a big group of tourists that wanted to have a closer look towards Mont Blanc… Here in the tunnels, there is an exit that leads down towards Valee Blanche. This exit is marked with all those &#039;Danger&#039; red and yellow fluorescent signs and fences that warn &#039;other&#039; people not to go there without a guide or proper equipment. As we were putting on the crampons and preparing the ice-axes under the close scrutiny of the tourists, I felt like this exit was like a door of a plane and we were getting ready to jump out of it with our parachutes on – the light that enters into these dark tunnels from outside is very bright and it really feels like going into the unknown from that point on… Anyway – we put on our helmets and glasses and we stepped out. I felt much better here… There was a very distinct path going down into the valley; there were surprisingly few people on it. I thought that this was probably because of the warning that was posted in the information office of Chamonix saying that because of the bad weather (too warm) there were many new big crevasses opened up in the mountains that made even the normal routes a little complicated to pass… This is a popular place where many guides from all around Europe go with their clients and probably they decided that it was not safe for the time being to take someone inexperienced. We came down and put our tent in the “big white” and there were about 10 more tents there scattered around… There was a really nice view here – we could see the summits of du Midi, du Tacul, Jorasses in the distance... But the sun was really warming up the place and all of a sudden the silence was interpreted with the crash of a stonefall down the North Face Triangle of du Tacul. We turned our heads immediately when we heard the sound and we could see the big rocks falling down towards the foot of the face followed by a cloud of dust. Everyone who was at their tents or climbing on the South East Pillar of du Midi was watching this sight; after a few seconds we all continued whatever we were doing, but it was a warning… We turned our sights towards the SSW Cosmique Ridge on Aiguille du Midi (3842m). We wanted to do it the next day and we also wanted to climb up on Mont Blanc du Tacul (4248m) over its normal NW Face route. In the distance I could see black spots moving on the Face and I could follow them and see the line where they were going, and about the ridge – I saw climbers when we were going down from the tunnels towards the Valee Blanche…     - Mont Blanc du Tacul, Mont Maudit and the Cosmiques Ridge of Aiguille du Midi That night we decided to go towards Mont Blanc (4848m) over du Tacul and Mont Maudit (4465m). We didn’t have any acclimatization, but we didn’t feel any problems at all going over du Tacul and climbing towards Mont Maudit. But we had a late start and the weather was getting warmer and warmer… We came to a point on Maudit where there was a 70meters high almost vertical piece of climbing to get on the ridge of this mountain after which some easy hiking of 2-3 hours was left to gain Mont Blanc. On the way up we met few parties returning from the top and when we came to this point, we waited for another 2 parties to rappel down since it was a narrow path leading to a safe belay stance on a piece of rock… Climbing towards it was really scary. By that time I was almost climbing in shorts and was over 4000m altitude in the Alps which at least for me was surprising… But when I started climbing the real problem showed up. Under the very fragile vertical ice I could hear water running down the vertical slope… The ice could break at any moment, my intuition was telling me that we should go back and I shouted out to Vesna that I was climbing down so that she could belay me properly. When I came back on safer ground we sat down, had something to eat and drink and decided to have a try the next day. The next day we actually decided to relax and go on the SSW “Cosmiques” Ridge of Aiguille du Midi. The route was first done by the Finch party on 29 August 1911. It is c260m long and it took us about 2 hours climbing. The overall grade is PD+ with a crux on the final rock pitches of IV. Although it is recommended as an “introduction to Alpine mixed climbing” (in the book “Mont Blanc Massif – Selected climbs”) on the whole way up because of the very warm weather we climbed on snow only for about ten meters on the traverse where the short rock wall starts before we got on the viewing platforms…It was easy climbing with nice views towards Chamonix on one side and Valee Blanche on the other. Arriving on the platform is done over a stair that ends right on the middle of the platform where most of the tourists are. Getting on the platform roped up together with our equipment hanging from our harnesses was really hard for us. To the tourists on the platform, it was like we had fallen from another planet, everyone was turning on their cameras to take a picture… We wanted to get out of there as soon as possible and be back safe down in the valley. Just when we arrived at the exit for the valley and thought we are safe a small group of Japanese tourists surrounded us excited about the opportunity to have a picture with us… They were really happy exclaiming all the time “...you are brave men…” When I was out in the snow away from all that noise I felt very happy about it. When we came down we decided to have a lunch at the Cosmique Hut. Upon hearing that the weather would get bad from the next day on we decided that immediately after the traverse tomorrow we would go back down to Chamonix. As far as we were concerned, we were using this visit of Valee Blanche and the surrounding mountains as an acclimatization process for another project that we wanted to do in Italy (around Monte Rosa) so we had no real plans to go climbing something big here.     - Moving through the du Tacul crevasses During the night we were awakened a few times with a roaring noise like the mountain was falling apart. It was thunder; I had a quick look out of the tent towards the sky but the sky looked clear somehow… At around 2 o’clock am we started getting ready again and this time we could see only about 10 people ahead of us. The weather was the reason for this since the skies now looked dark. After some time, just when we were crossing the last crevasse, a climber came alone and asked if he can join our rope. He was a good Spanish fellow who had a problem of waking up his partner so he started out alone but felt unsafe at the crevasse barrier… We accepted him and continued. It was totally different from 2 days previously. When we gained the highest point of the ridge of du Tacul we were not able to see anything from that point on. - Taking it easy It was like gray curtain… Everyone was making a short 30minutes walk toward the summit of this mountain and going down. We did the same and about that time the weather started to get much worse. It was snowing heavily and going down the steep track was tricky. We were roped all together - Vesna going as first, I was in the middle and our Spanish friend (I have trouble remembering names) was last. Suddenly I heard a strange noise and out of the corner of my eye I saw him sliding down the steep slope; I instantly screamed to Vesna to get down and drive her ice axe as fast as she could into the snow as I did the same; after two or three seconds there was a small jerk on the rope but it stopped at that point. It all happened so quickly but luckily the slope was not so steep and the ice was not that frozen so the fall was stopped without any bigger consequences. Needless to say, after this incident he was most grateful to us for accepting him in the party! The weather was getting worse and worse and when we came down in the valley we felt a very strong wind that almost ripped off our tent… With great difficulty we packed the tent, packed everything in our backpacks and headed towards the telepherique. There were no tourists there now - only us and a few other climbers. As we arrived in Chamonix the weather was partly cloudy and it looked like there was a storm approaching from the surrounding mountains. We decided to stay here one more day and after that departed towards Alagna, Italy… O Lord, You decide whether I should be At the foot of my aspiration-mountain Or on top of my aspiration-mountain. My surrender is my goal.                             -Sri Chinmoy (Taken from the book &quot;27000 Aspiration-Plants Pt. 263&quot;)" />

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/></span> <span class="c3" courier="" new="">After a long journey from our native Macedonia, together with my wife Vesna, <tt>w</tt></span><tt><span class="c3">e reached the French town of Chamonix. We really felt at home in this most beautiful town;</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">everything in the town breathes with the breath of the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">mountains:</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(people moving down-town with backpacks and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">harnesses on with equipment and still roped up together),</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">mountain-biking (we had few times very close encounter with bikers</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">dressed up like robocops – passing by on a narrow trail with lightning</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">speed), hiking,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">paragliding… On some houses there were paintings with</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing motifs on, even in the cinema there were two movies about</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing. It was amazing.<br/></span></tt></p>

<p class="c9"><span class="c8">- In Chamonix</span><br/></p>
<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Not having much time however, we decided to go to the mountains the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">very next day. In the morning we sorted out our gear, calculating what</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route we would do and how much we should take in our backpacks without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overloading them, before heading towards the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Aiguille du Midi Teleferique Station. After a fascinating ride which</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">took in a view towards the north face of this needlelike mountain where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we could see all the fine details of it, we arrived at the tunnels on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the top with a big group of tourists that wanted to have a closer look</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">towards Mont Blanc…<br/>
<br/></span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Here in the tunnels, there is an exit that leads down towards Valee</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Blanche. This exit is marked with all those 'Danger' red and yellow</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fluorescent signs and fences that warn 'other' people not to go there</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">without a guide or proper equipment. As we were putting on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">crampons and preparing the ice-axes under the close scrutiny of the</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>tourists, I felt like this exit was like a door of a plane and we were</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">getting ready to jump out of it with our parachutes on – the light that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ent</span></tt><tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">rs into these dark tunnels from outside is very bright and it</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">really feels like going into the unknown from that point on… Anyway –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we put on our helmets and glasses and we stepped out. I felt much</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">better here…</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
There was a very distinct path going down into the valley; there were</tt> <tt>surprisingly few people on it. I thought</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">that this was probably because of the warning that was posted in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the information office of Chamonix saying that because of the bad</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">weather</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(too</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">warm) there were many new big crevasses opened up in the mountains</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made even the normal routes a little complicated to pass… This is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a popular place where many guides from all around Europe go with their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">clients and probably they decided that it was not safe for the time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">to take someone inexperienced. We came down and put our tent in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“big white” and there were about 10 more tents there scattered around…<br/>
<br/></span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>There was a really nice view here – we could see the summits of du</tt> <tt>Midi, du Tacul, Jorasses in the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">distance... But the sun was really warming up the place and all of a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sudden the silence was interpreted with the crash of a stonefall down</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">North Face Triangle of du Tacul. We turned our heads immediately when</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we heard the sound and we could see the big rocks falling down towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">foot of the face followed by a cloud of dust. Everyone who was at</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">their tents or climbing on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">South East Pillar of du Midi was watching this sight; after a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">seconds we all continued whatever we were doing, but it was a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">warning…</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/></span></p>

<div class="c10"><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>We turned our sights towards the SSW Cosmique Ridge on Aiguille du</tt> <tt>Midi</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">(3842m).

In the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">distance I could see black spots moving on the Face and I could follow</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">them and see the line where they were going, and about the ridge – I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">saw climbers when we were going down from the tunnels towards the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Valee</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new="">Bl</span><tt><span class="c3">anche…<br/>

<p class="c9"><span class="c11">- Mont Blanc du Tacul, Mont Maudit and the Cosmiques Ridge of Aiguille du Midi</span><br/></p>
<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>That night we decided to go towards Mont Blanc (4848m) over du Tacul</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">and Mont Maudit (4465m). We didn’t have any acclimatization, but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we didn’t feel any problems at all going over du Tacul and climbing</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt>towards Mont Maudit. But we had a late start and the weather was</tt> <tt>getting warmer and warmer… We came to a point on Maudit where there</tt> <tt>was</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">a 70meters high almost vertical piece of climbing to get on the ridge</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of this mountain after which some easy hiking of 2-3 hours was left to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">gain Mont Blanc. On the way up we met few parties returning from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">top and when we came to this point, we waited for another 2 parties to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">rappel down since it was a narrow path leading to a safe belay stance</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on a piece of rock… Climbing towards it was really scary. By that time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was almost climbing in shorts and was over 4000m altitude in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Alps</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which at least for me was surprising… But when I started climbing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">real problem showed up. Under the very fragile vertical ice I could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hear water running down the vertical slope… The ice could break at any</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">moment, my intuition was telling me that we should go back and I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">shouted out to Vesna that I was climbing down so that she could belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">me properly. When I came back on safer ground we sat down, had</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">something to eat and drink and decided to have a try the next day.</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
The next day we actually decided to relax and go on the SSW</tt> <tt>“Cosmiques”</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Ridge of Aiguille du Midi. The route was first done by the Finch party</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on 29 August 1911. It is c260m long and it took us about 2 hours</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing. The overall grade is PD+ with a crux on the final rock</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of IV. Although it is recommended as an “introduction to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Alpine mixed climbing” (in the book “Mont Blanc Massif – Selected</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbs”) on the whole way up because of the very warm weather we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed on snow only for about ten meters on the traverse where the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">short rock wall starts before we got on the viewing platforms…</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">It was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">easy climbing with nice views towards Chamonix on one side and Valee</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Blanche on the other.</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
Arriving on the platform is done over a stair that ends right on the</tt> <tt>middle of the platform where most of the tourists are. Getting on the</tt> <tt>platform roped up together with our equipment hanging from our</tt> <tt>harnesses was really hard for us. To the tourists on the platform, it</tt> <tt>was like we had fallen from another planet, everyone was turning on</tt> <tt>their cameras to take a picture… We wanted to get out of there as soon</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">as possible and be back safe down in the valley. Just when we arrived</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">at</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the exit for the valley and thought we are safe a small group of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Japanese tourists surrounded us excited about the opportunity to have</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a picture with us… They were really happy exclaiming all the time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“...you are brave men…” When I was out in the snow away from all that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">noise I felt very happy about it.</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>

During the night we were awakened a few times with a roaring noise</tt> <tt>like the mountain was falling apart. It was thunder; I had a quick look</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">out of the tent towards the sky but the sky looked clear somehow… At</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">around 2 o’clock am we started getting ready again and this time we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could see only about 10 people ahead of us. The weather was the reason</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">for this since the skies now looked dark. After some time, just when</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">were crossing the last crevasse, a climber came alone and asked if he</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">can join our rope. He was a good Spanish fellow who had a problem of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">waking up his partner so he started out alone but felt unsafe at the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">crevasse barrier… We accepted him and continued. It was totally</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">different from 2 days previously. When we gained the highest point of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridge of du Tacul we were not able to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see anything from that point on.<br/></span></tt></p>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt><br/>
It was like gray curtain… Everyone was making a short 30minutes walk</tt> <tt>toward the summit of this mountain and going down. We did the same and</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">about that time the weather started to get much worse. It was snowing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">heavily and going down the steep track was tricky. We were roped all</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">together - Vesna going as first, I was in the middle and our Spanish</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friend (I have trouble remembering names) was last. Suddenly I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">heard a strange noise and out of the corner of my eye I saw</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">him sliding down the steep slope; I instantly screamed to Vesna to get</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down and drive her ice axe as fast as she could into the snow as I did</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">same; after two or three seconds there was a small jerk on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">rope but it stopped at that point. It all happened so quickly but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">luckily the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">slope was not so steep and the ice was not that frozen so the fall was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stopped without any bigger consequences. Needless to say, after this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">incident he was most grateful to us for accepting him in the party! The</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">weather was getting worse and worse and when we came down in the valley</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we felt a very strong wind that almost ripped off our tent… With great</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulty we packed the tent, packed everything in our backpacks and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">headed towards the telepherique. There were no tourists there now -</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only us and a few other climbers. As we arrived in Chamonix the weather</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was partly</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cloudy and it looked like there was a storm approaching from</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the surrounding mountains.

            <p class="documentDescription">...The spiritual way</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p><tt><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK">While <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>'s students have run ultramarathons, swum the</span></tt> <span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>English Channel and broken world endurance records in numerous</tt> <tt>fields, one feat of endurance has so far eluded them: climbing Mount</tt> <tt>Everest. If one intrepid group has its way, however, this might be</tt> <tt>next on the list.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Of course, it will be no small achievement. Though more people have</tt><tt>climbed Everest over the past 50 years than have swum the Channel,</tt> <tt>the height of 8,850 metres (29,035 feet) still seems an almost</tt> <tt>mythical quest (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/high14">The Highest 14...</a>).</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>One of the most experienced climbers on the team is New Yorker</tt> <tt>Anugata B., who has swum the Channel, completed several</tt> <tt>ultramarathon races, and run across the Sahara Desert. "I think the</tt> <tt>Channel gave me the confidence to climb mountains," he says.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Though he swam the Channel back in 1988, mountain-climbing had</tt> <tt>intrigued him since his childhood, when he was watching National</tt> <tt>Geographic specials on TV. "I remember one in particular where they</tt> <tt>were climbing the Alps. I think it was Walker Spur. I remember being</tt> <tt>absolutely floored by watching it. I wasn't saying at the time that</tt> <tt>I wanted to do that, but it really struck a chord inside of me."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Here, he reveals his techniques for what might yet be his greatest</tt> <tt>achievement – techniques which have their basis in his spiritual</tt> <tt>life.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Play to your body's strengths</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>Part of his interest in mountain-climbing, he says, is due to his</tt> <tt>body's physical traits. "My physical body's made for endurance, as</tt> <tt>opposed to high-intensity sports like sprinting or even high-level</tt> <tt>rock climbing."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Climb with friends who have the same goal</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>These climbers were already long-time friends. "We've all been <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri</a></tt> <tt><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Chinmoy</a>'s meditation students for a very long time, on average about</tt> <tt>25 years," says Anugata, "so we were meditating and pursuing other</tt> <tt>sports well before the four of us ever started climbing.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"We realised we had a similar goal: to climb a high mountain, and to</tt> <tt>really experience the atmosphere and the consciousness of the</tt> <tt>mountain. Especially the Himalayas, because it's the traditional</tt> <tt>seat of meditation for yogis who meditate in caves.</tt> <tt>The combination of the sporting life and the spiritual life, in an</tt> <tt>environment like that, is really, really satisfying."</tt><br/>

<tt>Anugata meditates every day. "The actual act of meditation – sitting</tt> <tt>down and really silencing your mind, that real inner stillness – is</tt> <tt>not so easy. At least, not for long periods of time, given the</tt> <tt>intense activity of the Western lifestyle. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has always</tt> <tt>used athletics to augment the meditative experience."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Anugata and his friends see mountain-climbing as a spiritual</tt> <tt>experience. Take their expedition to Mount Cho Oyu, which is near</tt> <tt>Everest. At 8,201 metres (26,906 feet), it is the world's sixth</tt> <tt>highest peak (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/high14">The Highest 14...</a>).</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"We had a puja [ceremony] before we started. We meditated at base</tt> <tt>camp every day. We tried to make it a pilgrimage, not just an</tt> <tt>'attack' on the mountain – a word that some people use. We were in</tt> <tt>Tibet, and we really wanted to feel our oneness with Tibet, with the</tt> <tt>villages and people, and just continue that feeling right up the</tt> <tt>mountain. We didn't have any porters or any help climbing. It was</tt> <tt>just four of us – and our cooks, down at base camp. We all made it</tt> <tt>to the top.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"The consciousness up at the top, when you're walking around with</tt> <tt>low oxygen, is just not earthly. It's more like being in an</tt> <tt>airliner, when you look out the window in the morning, except</tt> <tt>there's no plane. Living in that environment for several weeks, it</tt><br/>
<tt>was really easy to meditate out there."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Build up to your goal</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>The same advice applies to almost everything. Anugata has taken many</tt> <tt>years, with several sub-goals on his way to the main one.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"If you're mountaineering, it's not a question of just bagging a</tt> <tt>peak, then going home and telling people what you did. That's</tt> <tt>probably part of it, but you've got to pay your dues, just like</tt> <tt>anything in life. You have to decide this is a priority and go about</tt> <tt>it in a conscious way. If you want to climb higher altitudes, like</tt> <tt>the 8000-foot peaks, start at lower altitudes and work up.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"I'd been climbing about 12 years at that point, maybe two or three</tt> <tt>trips a year. I was just practising in and around New York, or going</tt> <tt>to South America or China or Alaska. The four of us had done various</tt> <tt>things that led us to believe that we could handle this 8000-metre</tt> <tt>climb in low oxygen.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"First you learn how to handle the altitude and perhaps take care of</tt> <tt>yourself. You have to be prepared for what happens with the weather</tt> <tt>– unexpected storms and things like that. You have to be prepared</tt> <tt>for the incredible cold at 8000 metres. That cold is really due to</tt> <tt>the lack of oxygen. When you get up between 7000 metres and 8000</tt> <tt>metres, there's not much oxygen in your body. It's not burning and</tt> <tt>producing a lot of heat, so you have these down suits and a lot of</tt> <tt>insulation. You have to be very careful to take care of your</tt> <tt>appendages – your hands, your nose, your toes. So that's another</tt> <tt>aspect of being prepared.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"There's a little bit of technical climbing, and as you soon as you</tt> <tt>progress high enough and start to do vertical rock climbing, it's</tt> <tt>really a heavy-duty thing. It really comes from meditation… without</tt> <tt>letting any negative emotion get in there, and just for the moment,</tt> <tt>always being the best that you can be. That's going to be,</tt><br/>
<tt>ultimately, your best achievement.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"Half of mountaineering is taking care of yourself. You can't really</tt> <tt>expect someone, even if it's your guide, to come up to you at every</tt> <tt>moment and say, 'How ya doing?' They may say that, but you might not</tt> <tt>be able to tell them how it really is going. It's really important</tt> <tt>to pay into the sport, but responsibly – I want to stress the word</tt><br/>
<tt>'responsibly' – get to the point where you can climb at that level."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt class="c6">Make climbing part of your life-philosophy</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>"When you spend a long time in an activity, you tend to get inside</tt> <tt>the activity and inside yourself," Anugata says. "You just have more</tt> <tt>time to let the higher experience happen."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>However, this should happen naturally. The activity itself comes</tt> <tt>first. "It's become a philosophy as I've gotten older, but I think</tt> <tt>philosophy starts as something you just do physically. The</tt> <tt>philosophy gets built around it.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"In a zen sense, you get into the actual activity. Visiting</tt> <tt>remote places, the pure living out in the mountain drinking the</tt> <tt>glacier water, is just something that you feel satisfied doing. If</tt> <tt>you get to the summit of the peaks that you want to, that's a plus."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Prepare yourself for the power of the mountain</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>"It's easy to get a magazine about climbing and get some pictures of</tt> <tt>the people on Everest or one of the other 8000-metre peaks. You see</tt> <tt>people climbing, but what you don't get is the tremendous vibration</tt> <tt>of the place, which is really soulful.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>In that area of the world – Tibet, Nepal and Pakistan – where the</tt> <tt>really high mountains are, you get this feeling of tremendous power</tt> <tt>in the atmosphere. It's almost tangible. At the same time, you're</tt> <tt>feeling this inner strength. But the physical body is really</tt> <tt>struggling. You look at photos of people climbing… but you don't</tt> <tt>really get a feeling of what they're experiencing."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>When you follow in their footsteps, of course, it all becomes clear.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"You see that you're made up of various elements. You're not just</tt> <tt>the body. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> has always taught us that there's the physical</tt> <tt>body, the vital energy, the mental energy, the heart power and the</tt> <tt>soul's power, and you start to see that separation when you get into</tt> <tt>very difficult athletic situations. The great art of meditation</tt> <tt>helps to clarify what's going on."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c5"><span class="c4" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><tt>Do it with the greatest motives</tt></span><br/></div>
<p><span class="c3" lang="MK" xml:lang="MK"><br/>
<tt>This is an experience to be savoured – not just reaching the goal,</tt> <tt>but every part of the activity. "If you don't really enjoy it,</tt> <tt>there's not a great chance that you'll get to the top, because</tt> <tt>you're talking about a couple of months of approach and climbing,</tt> <tt>and there's definitely hardship involved."</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>But while the activity might be difficult, Anugata says, enjoying it</tt> <tt>is a simple task. "The Everest climb might not even be your highest</tt> <tt>moment. Personally, I've had many of my own greatest moments. Many</tt> <tt>of them are not on the top of the mountain. Some of them are side</tt> <tt>issues to the climb. You can never tell when that moment of grace is</tt> <tt>going to descend on you. You're looking at the world with a new set</tt> <tt>of eyes.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"Getting ready, and taking the responsible steps to climb in the</tt> <tt>Himalayas, is just part of that. It's a whole path. We have a</tt> <tt>meditative path, and this is another path that is built around the</tt> <tt>meditative path.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>"It's more about trying to see God within the world. <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>'s</tt> <tt>philosophy is that he tries to see God's existence within the world.</tt> <tt>To get a glimpse of that is to get a foothold in that awareness. It</tt> <tt>requires us to try to silence ourselves, and get insight into what</tt> <tt>we are doing."</tt><br/>

            <p class="documentDescription">18/19 September 2004 - North Face of Aiguille du Midi by the route "Frendo Spur"</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<h3>Climbing up the North Face of Aiguille du Midi</h3>
<br/>
The many visitors that make the pilgrimage to the famous ski resort of Chamonix, France only have to look high up in the surrounding mountains to see the North Face of Aiguille du Midi. A short trip by lift gives them a unique opportunity to see every detail of all the major climbing routes, and sometimes one can even make out on the rockface the tiny spots of the climbers in action. During last year’s Alpine trip, I beheld the north face of Aiguille du Midi, and since then whoever asked me my plans for the next season was told emphatically that I want to go on Frendo, the imposing buttress that rises up almost straight through the middle of the big wall of Midi.<br/>
<br/>
The buttress is named after the Frendo-Rionda party, who did the first ascent by this route on 11 July 1941, followed twenty-three years later by the first winter ascent by the Stagni-Wohlschlag party on 21-22 January 1964. Our climb began on the seventeenth of September, 2004, when myself and my climbing partner, Ekalabhya, took what we needed for this climb up on to the glacier where we wanted to camp in order to have an early start the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c3" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/our route"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- The route</span><br/></div>
<br/>
I had spent all year reading as many descriptions as I could find  about the route, looking at some pictures, dreaming about it constantly - I thought that I knew everything there was to know. Maybe I did, but no amount of reading could have prepared me for that moment during our approach to the glacier when the true size of the task ahead dawned on me. 1200 meters of near-vertical rock face awaited us, starting up around 2600m and ending at the 3842 meters high summit. It was such an intimidating sight, and many times during our approach we had to avert our eyes as the the whole thing just became too mind-boggling. Everything that I thought I knew had just gone out the window. It was only when we set up our “base camp” and became occupied with the mundane jobs such as melting water that our anxiety went away and we could look at the route objectively, discussing matters such as where we could go faster and where we might have problems.<br/>
<br/>
We didn’t start particularly early the next morning and it wasnt untill 8:00am that we arrived under the rock itself, after a one-hour approach from our tent. The bergschrund (crevasse between the face and the glacier) was quite big and there was only one place were we could easily go on the rock. Up until now we had been quite calm and collected, but now we could see the true size of the rock features now that we were up close, and I was overwhelmed by the magnitude of it all. The north faces of the Alps are very cold during the whole day. At the beginning every touch on the rock was very uncomfortable but we were concentrating only on the climbing itself and after some time we forgot about the cold.<br/>
<br/>
We were climbing without any rest stops, trying to make our first bivouac place as high as possible, bearing in mind the last lift down from the mountain the next day left at 5:00pm. We didn’t have any problems finding our way on the rock - there was only one real route up, along the ridge, on either side of which there were only abysses and hold less slabs. From time to time we would find some leftovers from other climbing parties: cams, nuts, slings, a few pitons…<br/>
<br/>
The only problem was to get higher. But, not having acclimatized at all, we were moving increasingly more slowly the higher we ascended. Just before it got dark, we came under a vertical pillar that was raising four or five rope lengths up. We decided to sleep there,as we were unsure as to whether there was any better place to sleep further on. The sleep wasn't brilliant, to say the least. It got to the point when we would wake up because of the cold, wriggle around to warm up enough to go back to sleep, only to wake up again, and again...<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, the buttress rising up right in front of us did not seem half as scary as it was when we approached it from the glacier the day before. We knew where we should go, so we went. From that moment on the technical difficulty level of the climb was raised a notch or two and there was one or two times I really regretted not bringing my climbing shoes with me instead of the big plastic boots that I had. But once we started to encounter the parts with snow, I was more glad I brought my boots. We had been climbing for what seemed like ages and yet we still couldn’t see the start of the section where the rockface become covered completely in snow and ice. We changed the lead for what seemed like countless times. Finally we came to the snow arête where we could put on our crampons. From there we could see the station at the summit and we were confident that we would make it there before five o’clock. But it did not happen that way...<br/>
<br/>
In all the descriptions that I read, there was almost nothing written about the first two thirds of the route; it was this ice-arête that took all their attention, and when they were writing about the ice-arête you got the impression they were really inspired. And I couldsee why. The arête was so steep on both sides that we were basically crawling on it a few steps at time. The only way that we could belay ourselves was that if one of us were to fall the other one was supposed to jump down the other side of the arête! On the both sides abysses led down to the rocks and from there to the glacier 900 meters below. Understandably, we were very cautious.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="c5"><img class="c6" src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/ice"/><br/>
<span class="c4">- Igor starting the lead on the ice</span><br/></div>
<br/>
At one point we started traversing to the right because we wanted to go around the rognon- the rock that stretched all the way to the top. There we climbed on ice belaying with ice-screws. It was dark and the ice slope grew steeper as we went up. At one point when it was my turn to belay Ekalabhya to come to me, the slope was so steep I couldn’t stand normally and I had to hang on the ice-screws. We were joking that it was good that it was dark we would probably be not so relaxed if we could see where we were.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, we were only climbing and climbing, undisturbed by the height, the steepness, what lay to the right or left of us; only the cold disturbed us. I would climb to my stance and shiver uncontrollably whilst I was waiting for Ekalabhya to come to me and continue climbing another rope-length. When I saw my gloves frozen solid, I just had to laugh at the situation we were in.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Ekalabhya about the time and he said that it was exactly midnight. From then on, we continued climbing in silence. We just wanted to reach the end. We reached an area laden with crevasses. I was supposed to lead that part; I pointed the light of my headlamp in all directions but I couldn’t see any logical way to go. In the end, I just picked a direction and went because I didn’t want to stay in one place too long. I was climbing through very nice forms of ice with some crevasses to one side. When I reached my stance it was such a position that I thought that there is no way back and that we had to push straight. I couldn’t really see what was up there in the dark but I could see the lights at the summit. When Ekalabhya came and continued I could see from his light that we were very close to the top alright but his movements also showed me how bad the terrain was. When my turn came to start up I could see that I was right. The last two rope-lengths were full of hidden crevasses but Ekalabhya did a great job leading the way through and over them.<br/>
<br/>
At last, we reached the summit ridge and I could recognize the terrain. The track for the “White Valley” was going down on the other side and we were only a few minutes walk away to the tunnels of the Midi station.<br/>
<br/>
It was 3:00am when we arrived there. We had been climbing for 30 hours, 18 hours during the second day alone. After five hours we were on the glacier again, collecting our leftover gear and the tent, and happily looking back on route above us; this time our original apprehension had been replaced with a sense of satisfaction at a job well done.<br/>
<br/>
The climb was dedicated with gratitude to <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>.<br/></div>
