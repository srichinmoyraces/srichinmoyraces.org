<meta name="description" content="A SHORT VISIT... After a long journey from our native Macedonia, together with my wife Vesna, we reached the French town of Chamonix. We really felt at home in this most beautiful town; everything in the town breathes with the breath of the mountains: climbing (people moving down-town with backpacks and harnesses on with equipment and still roped up together),mountain-biking (we had few times very close encounter with bikers dressed up like robocops – passing by on a narrow trail with lightning speed), hiking, paragliding… On some houses there were paintings with climbing motifs on, even in the cinema there were two movies about climbing. It was amazing.     - In Chamonix Not having much time however, we decided to go to the mountains the very next day. In the morning we sorted out our gear, calculating what route we would do and how much we should take in our backpacks without overloading them, before heading towards the Aiguille du Midi Teleferique Station. After a fascinating ride which took in a view towards the north face of this needlelike mountain where we could see all the fine details of it, we arrived at the tunnels on the top with a big group of tourists that wanted to have a closer look towards Mont Blanc… Here in the tunnels, there is an exit that leads down towards Valee Blanche. This exit is marked with all those &#039;Danger&#039; red and yellow fluorescent signs and fences that warn &#039;other&#039; people not to go there without a guide or proper equipment. As we were putting on the crampons and preparing the ice-axes under the close scrutiny of the tourists, I felt like this exit was like a door of a plane and we were getting ready to jump out of it with our parachutes on – the light that enters into these dark tunnels from outside is very bright and it really feels like going into the unknown from that point on… Anyway – we put on our helmets and glasses and we stepped out. I felt much better here… There was a very distinct path going down into the valley; there were surprisingly few people on it. I thought that this was probably because of the warning that was posted in the information office of Chamonix saying that because of the bad weather (too warm) there were many new big crevasses opened up in the mountains that made even the normal routes a little complicated to pass… This is a popular place where many guides from all around Europe go with their clients and probably they decided that it was not safe for the time being to take someone inexperienced. We came down and put our tent in the “big white” and there were about 10 more tents there scattered around… There was a really nice view here – we could see the summits of du Midi, du Tacul, Jorasses in the distance... But the sun was really warming up the place and all of a sudden the silence was interpreted with the crash of a stonefall down the North Face Triangle of du Tacul. We turned our heads immediately when we heard the sound and we could see the big rocks falling down towards the foot of the face followed by a cloud of dust. Everyone who was at their tents or climbing on the South East Pillar of du Midi was watching this sight; after a few seconds we all continued whatever we were doing, but it was a warning… We turned our sights towards the SSW Cosmique Ridge on Aiguille du Midi (3842m). We wanted to do it the next day and we also wanted to climb up on Mont Blanc du Tacul (4248m) over its normal NW Face route. In the distance I could see black spots moving on the Face and I could follow them and see the line where they were going, and about the ridge – I saw climbers when we were going down from the tunnels towards the Valee Blanche…     - Mont Blanc du Tacul, Mont Maudit and the Cosmiques Ridge of Aiguille du Midi That night we decided to go towards Mont Blanc (4848m) over du Tacul and Mont Maudit (4465m). We didn’t have any acclimatization, but we didn’t feel any problems at all going over du Tacul and climbing towards Mont Maudit. But we had a late start and the weather was getting warmer and warmer… We came to a point on Maudit where there was a 70meters high almost vertical piece of climbing to get on the ridge of this mountain after which some easy hiking of 2-3 hours was left to gain Mont Blanc. On the way up we met few parties returning from the top and when we came to this point, we waited for another 2 parties to rappel down since it was a narrow path leading to a safe belay stance on a piece of rock… Climbing towards it was really scary. By that time I was almost climbing in shorts and was over 4000m altitude in the Alps which at least for me was surprising… But when I started climbing the real problem showed up. Under the very fragile vertical ice I could hear water running down the vertical slope… The ice could break at any moment, my intuition was telling me that we should go back and I shouted out to Vesna that I was climbing down so that she could belay me properly. When I came back on safer ground we sat down, had something to eat and drink and decided to have a try the next day. The next day we actually decided to relax and go on the SSW “Cosmiques” Ridge of Aiguille du Midi. The route was first done by the Finch party on 29 August 1911. It is c260m long and it took us about 2 hours climbing. The overall grade is PD+ with a crux on the final rock pitches of IV. Although it is recommended as an “introduction to Alpine mixed climbing” (in the book “Mont Blanc Massif – Selected climbs”) on the whole way up because of the very warm weather we climbed on snow only for about ten meters on the traverse where the short rock wall starts before we got on the viewing platforms…It was easy climbing with nice views towards Chamonix on one side and Valee Blanche on the other. Arriving on the platform is done over a stair that ends right on the middle of the platform where most of the tourists are. Getting on the platform roped up together with our equipment hanging from our harnesses was really hard for us. To the tourists on the platform, it was like we had fallen from another planet, everyone was turning on their cameras to take a picture… We wanted to get out of there as soon as possible and be back safe down in the valley. Just when we arrived at the exit for the valley and thought we are safe a small group of Japanese tourists surrounded us excited about the opportunity to have a picture with us… They were really happy exclaiming all the time “...you are brave men…” When I was out in the snow away from all that noise I felt very happy about it. When we came down we decided to have a lunch at the Cosmique Hut. Upon hearing that the weather would get bad from the next day on we decided that immediately after the traverse tomorrow we would go back down to Chamonix. As far as we were concerned, we were using this visit of Valee Blanche and the surrounding mountains as an acclimatization process for another project that we wanted to do in Italy (around Monte Rosa) so we had no real plans to go climbing something big here.     - Moving through the du Tacul crevasses During the night we were awakened a few times with a roaring noise like the mountain was falling apart. It was thunder; I had a quick look out of the tent towards the sky but the sky looked clear somehow… At around 2 o’clock am we started getting ready again and this time we could see only about 10 people ahead of us. The weather was the reason for this since the skies now looked dark. After some time, just when we were crossing the last crevasse, a climber came alone and asked if he can join our rope. He was a good Spanish fellow who had a problem of waking up his partner so he started out alone but felt unsafe at the crevasse barrier… We accepted him and continued. It was totally different from 2 days previously. When we gained the highest point of the ridge of du Tacul we were not able to see anything from that point on. - Taking it easy It was like gray curtain… Everyone was making a short 30minutes walk toward the summit of this mountain and going down. We did the same and about that time the weather started to get much worse. It was snowing heavily and going down the steep track was tricky. We were roped all together - Vesna going as first, I was in the middle and our Spanish friend (I have trouble remembering names) was last. Suddenly I heard a strange noise and out of the corner of my eye I saw him sliding down the steep slope; I instantly screamed to Vesna to get down and drive her ice axe as fast as she could into the snow as I did the same; after two or three seconds there was a small jerk on the rope but it stopped at that point. It all happened so quickly but luckily the slope was not so steep and the ice was not that frozen so the fall was stopped without any bigger consequences. Needless to say, after this incident he was most grateful to us for accepting him in the party! The weather was getting worse and worse and when we came down in the valley we felt a very strong wind that almost ripped off our tent… With great difficulty we packed the tent, packed everything in our backpacks and headed towards the telepherique. There were no tourists there now - only us and a few other climbers. As we arrived in Chamonix the weather was partly cloudy and it looked like there was a storm approaching from the surrounding mountains. We decided to stay here one more day and after that departed towards Alagna, Italy… O Lord, You decide whether I should be At the foot of my aspiration-mountain Or on top of my aspiration-mountain. My surrender is my goal.                             -Sri Chinmoy (Taken from the book &quot;27000 Aspiration-Plants Pt. 263&quot;)" />

We really felt at home in this most beautiful town;</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">everything in the town breathes with the breath of the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">mountains:</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(people moving down-town with backpacks and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">harnesses on with equipment and still roped up together),</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">mountain-biking (we had few times very close encounter with bikers</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">dressed up like robocops – passing by on a narrow trail with lightning</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">speed), hiking,</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">paragliding… On some houses there were paintings with</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing motifs on, even in the cinema there were two movies about</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing. It was amazing.<br/></span></tt></p>

<p class="c9"><span class="c8">- In Chamonix</span><br/></p>
<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Not having much time however, we decided to go to the mountains the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">very next day. In the morning we sorted out our gear, calculating what</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">route we would do and how much we should take in our backpacks without</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">overloading them, before heading towards the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Aiguille du Midi Teleferique Station. After a fascinating ride which</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">took in a view towards the north face of this needlelike mountain where</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we could see all the fine details of it, we arrived at the tunnels on</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the top with a big group of tourists that wanted to have a closer look</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">towards Mont Blanc…<br/>
<br/></span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Here in the tunnels, there is an exit that leads down towards Valee</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Blanche. This exit is marked with all those 'Danger' red and yellow</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">fluorescent signs and fences that warn 'other' people not to go there</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">without a guide or proper equipment. As we were putting on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">crampons and preparing the ice-axes under the close scrutiny of the</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>tourists, I felt like this exit was like a door of a plane and we were</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">getting ready to jump out of it with our parachutes on – the light that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ent</span></tt><tt><span class="c3" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">e</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">rs into these dark tunnels from outside is very bright and it</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">really feels like going into the unknown from that point on… Anyway –</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we put on our helmets and glasses and we stepped out. I felt much</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">better here…</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
There was a very distinct path going down into the valley; there were</tt> <tt>surprisingly few people on it. I thought</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">that this was probably because of the warning that was posted in</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the information office of Chamonix saying that because of the bad</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">weather</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">(too</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">warm) there were many new big crevasses opened up in the mountains</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">made even the normal routes a little complicated to pass… This is</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a popular place where many guides from all around Europe go with their</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">clients and probably they decided that it was not safe for the time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">being</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">to take someone inexperienced. We came down and put our tent in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“big white” and there were about 10 more tents there scattered around…<br/>
<br/></span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>There was a really nice view here – we could see the summits of du</tt> <tt>Midi, du Tacul, Jorasses in the</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">distance... But the sun was really warming up the place and all of a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">sudden the silence was interpreted with the crash of a stonefall down</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">North Face Triangle of du Tacul. We turned our heads immediately when</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we heard the sound and we could see the big rocks falling down towards</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">foot of the face followed by a cloud of dust. Everyone who was at</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">their tents or climbing on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">South East Pillar of du Midi was watching this sight; after a few</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">seconds we all continued whatever we were doing, but it was a</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">warning…</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/></span></p>

<div class="c10"><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>We turned our sights towards the SSW Cosmique Ridge on Aiguille du</tt> <tt>Midi</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">(3842m).

<p class="c9"><span class="c11">- Mont Blanc du Tacul, Mont Maudit and the Cosmiques Ridge of Aiguille du Midi</span><br/></p>
<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>That night we decided to go towards Mont Blanc (4848m) over du Tacul</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">and Mont Maudit (4465m). We didn’t have any acclimatization, but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we didn’t feel any problems at all going over du Tacul and climbing</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt>towards Mont Maudit. But we had a late start and the weather was</tt> <tt>getting warmer and warmer… We came to a point on Maudit where there</tt> <tt>was</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">a 70meters high almost vertical piece of climbing to get on the ridge</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">of this mountain after which some easy hiking of 2-3 hours was left to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">gain Mont Blanc. On the way up we met few parties returning from the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">top and when we came to this point, we waited for another 2 parties to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">rappel down since it was a narrow path leading to a safe belay stance</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on a piece of rock… Climbing towards it was really scary. By that time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">I was almost climbing in shorts and was over 4000m altitude in the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Alps</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">which at least for me was surprising… But when I started climbing the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">real problem showed up. Under the very fragile vertical ice I could</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">hear water running down the vertical slope… The ice could break at any</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">moment, my intuition was telling me that we should go back and I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">shouted out to Vesna that I was climbing down so that she could belay</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">me properly. When I came back on safer ground we sat down, had</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">something to eat and drink and decided to have a try the next day.</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
The next day we actually decided to relax and go on the SSW</tt> <tt>“Cosmiques”</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">Ridge of Aiguille du Midi. The route was first done by the Finch party</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">on 29 August 1911. It is c260m long and it took us about 2 hours</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbing. The overall grade is PD+ with a crux on the final rock</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">pitches of IV. Although it is recommended as an “introduction to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Alpine mixed climbing” (in the book “Mont Blanc Massif – Selected</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbs”) on the whole way up because of the very warm weather we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">climbed on snow only for about ten meters on the traverse where the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">short rock wall starts before we got on the viewing platforms…</span></tt><tt><span class="c3">It was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">easy climbing with nice views towards Chamonix on one side and Valee</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Blanche on the other.</span></tt><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt><br/>
Arriving on the platform is done over a stair that ends right on the</tt> <tt>middle of the platform where most of the tourists are. Getting on the</tt> <tt>platform roped up together with our equipment hanging from our</tt> <tt>harnesses was really hard for us. To the tourists on the platform, it</tt> <tt>was like we had fallen from another planet, everyone was turning on</tt> <tt>their cameras to take a picture… We wanted to get out of there as soon</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">as possible and be back safe down in the valley. Just when we arrived</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">at</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the exit for the valley and thought we are safe a small group of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">Japanese tourists surrounded us excited about the opportunity to have</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">a picture with us… They were really happy exclaiming all the time</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">“...you are brave men…” When I was out in the snow away from all that</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">noise I felt very happy about it.</span></tt> <span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>

During the night we were awakened a few times with a roaring noise</tt> <tt>like the mountain was falling apart. It was thunder; I had a quick look</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">out of the tent towards the sky but the sky looked clear somehow… At</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">around 2 o’clock am we started getting ready again and this time we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">could see only about 10 people ahead of us. The weather was the reason</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">for this since the skies now looked dark. After some time, just when</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">were crossing the last crevasse, a climber came alone and asked if he</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">can join our rope. He was a good Spanish fellow who had a problem of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">waking up his partner so he started out alone but felt unsafe at the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">crevasse barrier… We accepted him and continued. It was totally</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">different from 2 days previously. When we gained the highest point of</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">ridge of du Tacul we were not able to</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">see anything from that point on.<br/></span></tt></p>

It was like gray curtain… Everyone was making a short 30minutes walk</tt> <tt>toward the summit of this mountain and going down. We did the same and</tt></span> <tt><span class="c3">about that time the weather started to get much worse. It was snowing</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">heavily and going down the steep track was tricky. We were roped all</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">together - Vesna going as first, I was in the middle and our Spanish</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">friend (I have trouble remembering names) was last. Suddenly I</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">heard a strange noise and out of the corner of my eye I saw</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">him sliding down the steep slope; I instantly screamed to Vesna to get</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">down and drive her ice axe as fast as she could into the snow as I did</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">same; after two or three seconds there was a small jerk on the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">rope but it stopped at that point. It all happened so quickly but</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">luckily the</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">slope was not so steep and the ice was not that frozen so the fall was</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">stopped without any bigger consequences. Needless to say, after this</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">incident he was most grateful to us for accepting him in the party! The</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">weather was getting worse and worse and when we came down in the valley</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">we felt a very strong wind that almost ripped off our tent… With great</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">difficulty we packed the tent, packed everything in our backpacks and</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">headed towards the telepherique. There were no tourists there now -</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">only us and a few other climbers. As we arrived in Chamonix the weather</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">was partly</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">cloudy and it looked like there was a storm approaching from</span></tt> <tt><span class="c3">the surrounding mountains.

            <div class="documentBody"><tt>– April 10 and 15, 2006, N.Y.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>It has been an old dream of mine to celebrate something with climbing,</tt> <tt>a concentration and strength-sport activity that matches effort with</tt> <tt>fun. To celebrate the 42nd anniversary of our spiritual tutor's arrival</tt> <tt>to the West, Charita, Dharmaputri, Elke and I decided to climb 42</tt> <tt>climbing routes. Since it was the closest to our N.Y. headquarters, and</tt> <tt>also because on the first day the weather wasn't nice at all, we drove</tt> <tt>to an indoor climbing centre on Long Island.</tt><br/>
<div class="c3"/>

<br/>
<tt>((((For the sake of the non-initiated ones: by indoor routes I mean</tt> <tt>vertical routes, basically sets of coloured hand and footholds</tt> <tt>specially designed and screwed on (almost) vertical and overhanging</tt> <tt>walls. There are routes of various difficulty degree (the degrees are</tt> <tt>numbered differently on the different continents), according to how</tt> <tt>many and how big or how ”easy-to-hold-on-to” these grips are. There may</tt> <tt>be several routes built on the same section of the wall, it is their</tt> <tt>colour or the colour of the stripe underneath that distinguishes one</tt> <tt>route from another. Once you start climbing one of them, you may touch</tt> <tt>holds of that colour only.</tt> <tt>For safety reasons climbers use ropes and special belaying devices. In</tt> <tt>this case, three of us travelling from another continent with an</tt> <tt>already big luggage, we had not had much gear with us, except for our</tt> <tt>harnesses, shoes and chalk bags (chalk being needed to prevent our</tt> <tt>sweaty hands from slipping off the small or rounded holds). Therefore</tt> <tt>we could only use the ropes and gri-gris (a belaying device that blocks</tt> <tt>the rope in case the climber falls) pre-installed and did only</tt> <tt>top-roping (the rope comes from above, one end of it being attached to</tt> <tt>the climber's harness, while its other end being held end pulled in or</tt> <tt>fed out through a gri-gri by the belaying person; it is considered that</tt> <tt>easiest and safest way). ))))</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Participants include (in alphabetical order): Charita (the young spider</tt> <tt>of El Salvador, a particularly talented beginner with very nice, light,</tt> <tt>long and wide moves), Dharmaputri (the tough lady of the Swiss Alps and</tt> <tt>Mont Blanc, conqueror of many alpine summits including some north</tt> <tt>faces), Elke W. (who has thus made a successful return to the climbing</tt> <tt>world she left some years ago with very good results in her bag –</tt> <tt>routes of degree 7a-c on the European scale) and my humble self,</tt> <tt>Kamalika (a not particularly remarkable climber if a climber at all,</tt> <tt>but definitely a great lover of the altitudes and of the vertical world</tt> <tt>regardless of whether it consists of rock, of the compressed ice of a</tt> <tt>glacier or of the frozen ice of a waterfall).</tt><br/>

The</tt> <tt>second occasion Dharmaputri joined us and again we had to climb 6</tt> <tt>routes each in order to have 42 all together. Of course we transcended</tt> <tt>this a bit. Also, the other three girls did a bit of difficult</tt> <tt>bouldering, but we did not count those shorter but much harder boulder</tt> <tt>routes.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>We are fully conscious that none of the climbs illustrated here would</tt> <tt>make a headline in the alpine or climbing magazines, nevertheless we</tt> <tt>sweated a lot, we had great fun and all of us made more or less</tt> <tt>progress in improving our technique and style. Actually that was the</tt> <tt>point in doing it, with these climbs we lived what Sri Chinmoy teaches</tt> <tt>us: improve yourself, transcend yourself, do not compete with others</tt> <tt>but with yourself – and be happy.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>I hope to be able to say that this was a pilot-project (testing the</tt> <tt>thing) and now that we saw that IT WORKS, it will be followed by more.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Gratitude,</tt><br/>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Most of the climbing “scene” in Macedonia at</tt> <tt>this moment is concentrated in the capital, Skopje, and many</tt> <tt>foreign climbers passing through the country mostly stay there, so I</tt> <tt>should first mention the local climbing area in Skopje, called Matka.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Matka is a canyon on the river Treska situated only 30 minutes drive</tt> <tt>from Skopje. This is a very special place where in the past</tt> <tt>there were thriving orthodox monasteries and the silent prayers of</tt> <tt>the monks enchanted the entire area with eternal peace. Now there is</tt> <tt>only one working monastery, but the churches dotted everywhere around</tt> <tt>still spread the calming vibration throughout the area.<br/></tt></span></p>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt> </tt><br/></span></p>
<div class="c8"><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>The artificial lake on the river with a hut on its bank inspire</tt> <tt>many people to visit the place regularly – just to sit and enjoy the</tt> <tt>afternoon after work or the weekend with their family and friends.</tt> <tt>The river is famous for its kayaking course where European or world</tt> <tt>championships are held. Also, because of the limestone character of</tt> <tt>the area there are many unusual caves can be found that are subject of</tt> <tt>research by local and international speleology teams, not to mention</tt> <tt>the great possibilities for hiking... But for me the most important</tt> <tt>thing is the rock jutting upwards about 200 metres high. The</tt> <tt>rock is limestone and very unstable and fragile, yet this is where we</tt> <tt>all made our first steps in the climbing world and it is very dear to</tt> <tt>us. There are many routes of four or five pitches and a also few</tt> <tt>sport-climbing playgrounds, the closest of which is very near to the</tt> <tt>hut (which is only 10 minutes walk from the parking lot); the rest are</tt> <tt>not so very far from the hut either.<br/>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>We visit the place at least every weekend; often it happens that</tt> <tt>we come almost every day of the week. The routes are, as I said, 4-5</tt> <tt>pitches long, with grades from III up to VII- (and up to VIII for the</tt> <tt>sport climbing routes).</tt><br/>
<br/></span></p>
<div class="c7">
<div class="c8"><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><tt>Other areas that we visit for rock climbing in Macedonia are <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/dkapija">Demir</a></tt> <tt><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/recent/dkapija">Kapija</a> that has a limestone rock about 300 meters high and Soulunska</tt> <tt>Glava that has a big amphitheather that in its middle section reaches a</tt> <tt>height of 600 meters. The exit is on the top of 2538m high Jakupica,</tt> <tt>making the climbing a real mountain adventure. Due to</tt> <tt>the long approach and exit route, the remoteness and unstable</tt> <tt>character of the rock (limestone, again) this face is not</tt> <tt>frequently climbed and has many possibilities for new routes.<br/>

<p><span class="c3" courier="" new=""><br/>
<tt>The whole climbing “scene” in the coutnry is in a period of</tt> <tt>“awakening”</tt> <tt>and the local climbers are working on the revival of these and other</tt> <tt>areas: for example, Ostra Karpa, with its granite rock and the frozen</tt> <tt>waterfalls in the very scenic mountains in the</tt> <tt>western part of the country…. I will soon write about some of these</tt> <tt>places; we all</tt> <tt>hope that very soon they will be put on the “must-do” list</tt> <tt>of all climbers visiting this part of Europe.<br/></tt></span></p>
