<meta name="description" content="– April 10 and 15, 2006, N.Y. It has been an old dream of mine to celebrate something with climbing, a concentration and strength-sport activity that matches effort with fun. To celebrate the 42nd anniversary of our spiritual tutor&#039;s arrival to the West, Charita, Dharmaputri, Elke and I decided to climb 42 climbing routes. Since it was the closest to our N.Y. headquarters, and also because on the first day the weather wasn&#039;t nice at all, we drove to an indoor climbing centre on Long Island.      (click for more photos...) ((((For the sake of the non-initiated ones: by indoor routes I mean vertical routes, basically sets of coloured hand and footholds specially designed and screwed on (almost) vertical and overhanging walls. There are routes of various difficulty degree (the degrees are numbered differently on the different continents), according to how many and how big or how ”easy-to-hold-on-to” these grips are. There may be several routes built on the same section of the wall, it is their colour or the colour of the stripe underneath that distinguishes one route from another. Once you start climbing one of them, you may touch holds of that colour only. For safety reasons climbers use ropes and special belaying devices. In this case, three of us travelling from another continent with an already big luggage, we had not had much gear with us, except for our harnesses, shoes and chalk bags (chalk being needed to prevent our sweaty hands from slipping off the small or rounded holds). Therefore we could only use the ropes and gri-gris (a belaying device that blocks the rope in case the climber falls) pre-installed and did only top-roping (the rope comes from above, one end of it being attached to the climber&#039;s harness, while its other end being held end pulled in or fed out through a gri-gri by the belaying person; it is considered that easiest and safest way). )))) Participants include (in alphabetical order): Charita (the young spider of El Salvador, a particularly talented beginner with very nice, light, long and wide moves), Dharmaputri (the tough lady of the Swiss Alps and Mont Blanc, conqueror of many alpine summits including some north faces), Elke W. (who has thus made a successful return to the climbing world she left some years ago with very good results in her bag – routes of degree 7a-c on the European scale) and my humble self, Kamalika (a not particularly remarkable climber if a climber at all, but definitely a great lover of the altitudes and of the vertical world regardless of whether it consists of rock, of the compressed ice of a glacier or of the frozen ice of a waterfall).      (click for more photos...) The first occasion three of us climbed (”on-sight”) 6 routes each. The second occasion Dharmaputri joined us and again we had to climb 6 routes each in order to have 42 all together. Of course we transcended this a bit. Also, the other three girls did a bit of difficult bouldering, but we did not count those shorter but much harder boulder routes. We are fully conscious that none of the climbs illustrated here would make a headline in the alpine or climbing magazines, nevertheless we sweated a lot, we had great fun and all of us made more or less progress in improving our technique and style. Actually that was the point in doing it, with these climbs we lived what Sri Chinmoy teaches us: improve yourself, transcend yourself, do not compete with others but with yourself – and be happy. I hope to be able to say that this was a pilot-project (testing the thing) and now that we saw that IT WORKS, it will be followed by more. Gratitude, Kamalika" />

<br/>
<tt>It has been an old dream of mine to celebrate something with climbing,</tt> <tt>a concentration and strength-sport activity that matches effort with</tt> <tt>fun. To celebrate the 42nd anniversary of our spiritual tutor's arrival</tt> <tt>to the West, Charita, Dharmaputri, Elke and I decided to climb 42</tt> <tt>climbing routes. Since it was the closest to our N.Y. headquarters, and</tt> <tt>also because on the first day the weather wasn't nice at all, we drove</tt> <tt>to an indoor climbing centre on Long Island.</tt><br/>

In</tt> <tt>this case, three of us travelling from another continent with an</tt> <tt>already big luggage, we had not had much gear with us, except for our</tt> <tt>harnesses, shoes and chalk bags (chalk being needed to prevent our</tt> <tt>sweaty hands from slipping off the small or rounded holds). Therefore</tt> <tt>we could only use the ropes and gri-gris (a belaying device that blocks</tt> <tt>the rope in case the climber falls) pre-installed and did only</tt> <tt>top-roping (the rope comes from above, one end of it being attached to</tt> <tt>the climber's harness, while its other end being held end pulled in or</tt> <tt>fed out through a gri-gri by the belaying person; it is considered that</tt> <tt>easiest and safest way). ))))</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Participants include (in alphabetical order): Charita (the young spider</tt> <tt>of El Salvador, a particularly talented beginner with very nice, light,</tt> <tt>long and wide moves), Dharmaputri (the tough lady of the Swiss Alps and</tt> <tt>Mont Blanc, conqueror of many alpine summits including some north</tt> <tt>faces), Elke W. (who has thus made a successful return to the climbing</tt> <tt>world she left some years ago with very good results in her bag –</tt> <tt>routes of degree 7a-c on the European scale) and my humble self,</tt> <tt>Kamalika (a not particularly remarkable climber if a climber at all,</tt> <tt>but definitely a great lover of the altitudes and of the vertical world</tt> <tt>regardless of whether it consists of rock, of the compressed ice of a</tt> <tt>glacier or of the frozen ice of a waterfall).</tt><br/>

<a href="http://www.srichinmoycentre.org/gallery/members/kamalika/The_42_climbs_project/">(click for more photos...)</a><br/></div>
<br/>
<tt>The first occasion three of us climbed (”on-sight”) 6 routes each. The</tt> <tt>second occasion Dharmaputri joined us and again we had to climb 6</tt> <tt>routes each in order to have 42 all together. Of course we transcended</tt> <tt>this a bit. Also, the other three girls did a bit of difficult</tt> <tt>bouldering, but we did not count those shorter but much harder boulder</tt> <tt>routes.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>We are fully conscious that none of the climbs illustrated here would</tt> <tt>make a headline in the alpine or climbing magazines, nevertheless we</tt> <tt>sweated a lot, we had great fun and all of us made more or less</tt> <tt>progress in improving our technique and style. Actually that was the</tt> <tt>point in doing it, with these climbs we lived what Sri Chinmoy teaches</tt> <tt>us: improve yourself, transcend yourself, do not compete with others</tt> <tt>but with yourself – and be happy.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>I hope to be able to say that this was a pilot-project (testing the</tt> <tt>thing) and now that we saw that IT WORKS, it will be followed by more.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Gratitude,</tt><br/>

            <p class="documentDescription">An inspirational read: 26.2 Marathon Stories, by Kathrine Switzer and Roger Robinson</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<p>Anything you ever wanted to know about the mighty marathon race is in this book. If you have ever taken part in a marathon, running or supporting, you will find yourself compelled to keep reading chapter after chapter, as the topics roll from the history and first beginnings of the race, (which turns out to be somewhat fictional), to the ecstasy of the completion, with many stages in between; a total of 26.2, or 27, topics.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the health benefits of running are widely accepted and documented, but this knowledge is actually quite recent. A New York Times issue from 1909 declared,</p>
<blockquote>"Every man who undertakes the running of 26 miles weakens his heart and shortens his life. For the great majority of adults particularly in an urban population, to take part in a Marathon race is to risk serious and permanent injury to health, with immediate death a danger not very remote."</blockquote>
<p>The popularity and acceptance of marathon running actually only began in the 1960's. One of the instigators was the great New Zealand running coach, Arthur Lydiard, who wrote a landmark book called 'Run for Your Life'. He maintained that running was good for everybody, and his philosophy produced astounding results, particularly with post-cardiac patients.</p>
<p>Some of the scientifically proven side effects of running quoted from 26.2 Marathon Stories are;</p>
<blockquote>"By strengthening the heart, running reduces the rate of heart disease. By pumping oxygen and antioxidants, it combats carcinogenic free radicals, and so reduces the incidence of many forms of cancer...it diminishes lingering toxins. By raising body temperature to fever level on a daily basis, it burns out infection. By stimulating sweating and increasing breath exchange, it eliminates toxins via the skin and expelled air. By releasing adrenaline, it flushes the system with disease-fighting white blood cells and immune substances. By reducing body weight, it counters the effects of obesity- stress on the heart, joints, lungs and muscles, and non-insulin dependant diabetes. By stimulating endorphins, it alleviates stress, counters depression, and enhances creativity and problem solving. By strengthening bones, it radically reduces the incidence of osteoporosis...finally, by leaving the body fulfilled and tired, running helps maintain healthy sleep patterns."</blockquote>
<p>One chapter entitled 'motivations' quotes many well-known, and some unknown, runners;</p>
<blockquote>"If you want to run, run a mile. If you want to experience another life, run a marathon'</blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Emil Zatopek.</p>
<blockquote>"There are only three winners: the one who competes with himself, the one who crosses the finish line first, and the one who finishes the race'</blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> <a class="reference" href="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/sri_chinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a>, The Outer Running and Inner Running.</p>
<blockquote>"We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves. It also does us good because it helps us to do other things better. It gives a man the chance to bring out power that might otherwise remain locked away inside himself. The urge to struggle lies latent in everyone"</blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Roger Bannister, FIRST FOUR MINUTES.</p>
<blockquote>"I started running at age 72 because I was tired of all the boring talk about funerals"</blockquote>
<p><cite>-</cite> Ruth Rothfarb (who ran her first marathon at age 81)</p>
<p>26.2 Marathon Stories tells of the fight for women to race, which Kathrine Switzer brought to world attention in 1967 when she broke the rules by running the then 'males only' Boston Marathon. Today nearly half of the marathon runners are, in fact, women.</p>
<p>Many great running heroes are documented, giving great inspiration to the reader, however the focus is well balanced between the elite athletes and the millions of people around the world who bravely take up the challenge, experience the struggles, and are left with that unmatchable feeling of the completion of the race. A highly recommendable read for all aspiring marathon runners and non runners alike.</p>

            <p class="documentDescription">A beginner's guide to Fell Racing By Roger Chamberlain, Sri Chinmoy Athletic Club, Cardiff. This article is a short introduction to fell racing in the UK for the total beginner. It covers the essential topics of kitting yourself out for the event, training, choosing your race and race day itself.</p>
<div class="documentBody">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br/></div>
</div>
<p>I have been running in the mountains of England and Wales for about seven years now and have represented my club, the <a class="reference" href="http://uk.srichinmoyraces.org/">Sri Chinmoy AC</a> , in numerous races from 'S' class events under two miles to 'L' class runs taking several hours. I've made plenty of mistakes, gradually discovered how to get the best out of myself in a fell race and learnt a great deal on the way. I'm not the most experienced of fell runners, but you are a complete beginner wanting to try fell racing I hope this article will answer most of your questions.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br/></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choosing-your-target-race">
<h3>Choosing your target race.</h3>
<p>My first fell race was an 'AL' of 17 miles with several thousand feet of ascent. Having run several marathons and even an ultra (the Sri Chinmoy 47 Mile Race), I thought I should be fit to race over that distance. I has also seen fellow <a class="reference" href="http://uk.srichinmoyraces.org/">Sri Chinmoy AC</a> members complete the 90+ mile West Highland Way and other endurance events, and I seriously underestimated what I was taking on. I "blew up" part way through the second climb, light headed and totally spent. The strain had an effect on my digestion and I experienced painful stomach cramps on the downhill sections which could otherwise have offered some respite. I staggered over the line quite near the back of the field - not quite last - resolving to build myself up with some shorter events before tackling another epic.</p>
<p>Even if you are very fit, the best approach to fell racing is to enter some short class B or C races (the class indicates how many feet of climbing there are per mile) before tackling a longer or tougher event. Races listed as BS or CS in the FRA calendar (or the equivalent publication in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland) would be ideal.</p>
<p>Another factor in choosing your race, apart from the distance and climb involved, is the need for navigation. Races listed as NS and ER in the calendar require navigational skills and fell racing experience. A listing of LK indicates that local knowledge would be an advantage. If in doubt, call or email the race organiser and ask how suitable the race is for a beginner.</p>

<div class="section" id="equipment-for-fell-running">
<h3>Equipment for Fell Running</h3>
<p>By the time you've run on the fells enough to want to race on them, you should know pretty well which fell shoes are right for you. Don't be tempted to try anything new on the day - tried and trusted is best.</p>
<p>As far as clothing is concerned, take what you need for the worst-case-scenario conditions. In a short race you can probably run in minimal kit (vest &amp; shorts) unless the weather conditions are bad. Remember this means the conditions up top as well as those at the start - things could be somewhat different up at 2000' compared to what's going on down in the valley. A short race may not have mandatory kit requirements, but you may want to carry an extra layer (e.g. jacket) in your bum bag even if it's not required by the rules. The race organiser may insist that you carry full body cover (windproof or waterproof depending on how bad the weather is) as well as emergency food, a suitable map, a compass and a whistle. Maps and compasses are mandatory in many races, as is the whistle for attracting attention if you get lost or injured. Learning how to navigate is outside the scope of this article (see bibliography - the mountain-craft book has a good chapter on compass work). If you aren't confident to navigate, select a race where navigational skills are not essential - there are some that use paths that can be easily followed and others that utilise course markers (usually hazard tape pegged at regular intervals). Again, the race organiser will advise you about the requirements for their own event.</p>
<p>Kit needs to be carried in a bum bag (waist pack) that fits well enough for you to run at race pace while wearing it. Pete Bland, Lowe Alpine and OMM all produce suitable bags which you can find at running shops and some hiking/camping stores.</p>
<p>Runners vary wildly in their clothing requirements during races - some are prone to overheating and need to race in vest &amp; shorts even when it's cold. Others experience a dip in performance unless they wear layers to keep them warm. Learn in advance what your requirements are and stick to them on race day even if more experienced runners are all in very different kit to you.</p>

<div class="section" id="training-for-a-fell-race">
<h3>Training for a Fell Race.</h3>
<p>It's not rocket science - to race on hills you need to train on hills. The simplest way to train for a short fell race is to do some runs on hills of similar toughness - if the race is three miles of running with eight hundred feet of climbing, then work up to that in your training. Start with shorter climbs, or start by walking up and jogging down. Walking is a part of fell running - in most races the competitors are walking at least part of the climb, as it's more efficient to do that than to run it all as fast as you can then collapse at the top with no energy left to run down (while those who took it easy on the climb come sailing past). So the easiest way to train for your race is to get out on the mountains and walk-run your way up and down, getting used to the challenges of both climbing and descending and generally getting to know the fells and your own capabilities. Gradually, your ankles will get stronger and better able to cope with the uneven ground, your leg muscles will develop (especially the quads) and your balance and ability to pick the best line through fell country will improve.</p>
<p>Extra sessions you can work into your program could include "reps" (repetitions) of short climbs and/or descents which might be something you can do every day even of the mountains are not nearby. I practise repetitions on a short slope (1-2 minutes of steep climbing) behind my local supermarket, whereas a "proper" fell run involves a drive of at least half an hour to my nearest thousand foot mountain. If you can't get out to proper hill country regularly, at least try to train off-road so you get used to the uneven terrain. Obviously you need to include hilly, or at least undulating, courses in your weekly routine as much as possible.</p>
<p>I could get much more precise and technical about the requirements, as some coaches doubtlessly would if you asked them about fell-race training, but I think as simple approach that gets you out there having fun and gradually brings you to the right level of preparedness for a fell race is the most sensible approach. Once you have a few fell races under your belt, you can think about honing your performance with more elaborate or challenging training.</p>

<div class="section" id="race-day">
<h3>Race Day</h3>
<p>This is the exciting bit. Racing in the fells. Of course, as in road racing, excitement can lead to a runner going off way too fast and "blowing up" or "hitting the wall" (running out of energy and feeling totally spent). Take it easy at the start and don't expect to be keeping up with vastly more experienced fell runners - if you are, it will probably spell trouble later on. Remember that downhill running is also very taxing, so even if the race only involves a single ascent and descent, you can't use up all your fuel on the climb.</p>
<p>Before the race begins, you need to warm up well to get your body ready for the tough task ahead - this is more important in fell racing than in some other events because shorter races are likely to begin with a challenging climb, which your body won't find easy if you go for it "cold", straight from the car. Everyone is different, but I find fifteen to twenty minutes of slow jogging enough to get my body warmed up ready to race. I usually add in a few short dashes up and down slopes to get my leg muscles used to the ascending/descending. During this warm-up you'll find out if you are over- or underdressed for the conditions and you might want to adjust your kit accordingly. Mentally, my preparation consists of a few moments of silence after warm-up and before the start. This helps me to focus, calm my nerves and clear my mind. There is usually a short briefing at the start line from the race organiser and then the runners head off. What do you need to remember? Don't go off too fast!</p>
<p>Before you even start warming up for the race, you need to register and get into your racing kit with your bumbag and all its contents ready for the start. Bearing this in mind, get to the start nice and early if you can. If you're smart, you'll have double checked the kit requirements with the race organiser (either by calling them or through checking their web site/entry form) and brought everything you need to avoid any last minute panics. As with any type of running event, you'll need to have left plenty of time since you last ate to make sure food is fully digested (I tend to breakfast on a couple of high-carb energy bars three hours before the start) and have been to the loo before the race. I mention that last rather obvious point because many races don't have facilities at the start - you may need to stop at a toilet down the road before you arrive.</p>
<p>Most races don't provide any water on the course, and for shorter races you just need to be properly hydrated when you get there. If you are sure you need a drink during the race, you'll to carry it yourself.</p>

<h3>Some easy mistakes to avoid</h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>He looks like he knows where he's going, I'll follow him....</li>
</ol>
<p>A classic mistake....either trust your map skills, recce the route in advance or choose a race where the route is easy to follow. Following other runners like a sheep will work some of the time, but not all the time.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>I'm good on hills so I'll go fast on the climbs...</li>
</ol>
<p>That might leave you with nothing left for the descents, which make up half the race.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>The weather looks good, I won't bother taking my jacket...</li>
</ol>
<p>The organiser may have seen a different weather forecast, or for some other reason may insist on you carrying full kit.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>I'll try this new energy drink , it might give me a boost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless it's a long race, stick to water. In an endurance event only use what you've tried out in training. The rigours of fell running make life hard for the digestive system so it's best to avoid any chance of upsetting things.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-finally">
<h3>And finally.......</h3>
<p>So that's it - the training will prepare you in terms of fitness and learning to cope with the conditions. The race will give you a great opportunity to put all your learning into practise and compete alongside others who love running on the fells. The real competition is against your own limits - the competition of "<a class="reference" href="http://uk.srichinmoyraces.org/resources/manatita">Self-Transcendence</a> " - so even if you come last, if you gave it your all, that's an achievement in itself. Good luck, and (for the last time) don't go off too fast!</p>
