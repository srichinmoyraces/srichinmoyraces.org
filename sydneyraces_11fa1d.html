<div class="documentBody">
<p>3 June<br/>
Finding the start of the route called âVia del Bucoâ on the South-West Face of Piccolo Lagazuoi was a little tricky since I recognized the roof in the third pitch looking up from the base of this wall but I was not sure which corner to take since there were two almost close to each other. While going up and down on the scree gully two older Swiss climbers approached the face and came close where I was standing. They didnât understand a word English but I just mentioned the name of the route and the leader of the party showed me the right hand corner. (There was an orange piton driven in at the start of the left corner, which got my attention). We were ready to start so we went ahead of them and in the first 2-3 pitches they were following us very close. The leader would come at the belay stance while Vesna was belayingâ¦After that they somehow slowed down since the second climber was going slowly but we waited for them at the top and took a picture with us all together because I was very inspired by watching them still climbing at the ages of 53 and 78. Â We had a small chat at the top, using my broken German. They reminded me an interview I read with Anderl Heckmair (the leader of the first ascent party of the North Face of Eiger in 1938). He was then 93 years old and answering the question when did he stop climbing, he said âtwo years ago (when he was 91) because he had some strange pain in the legâ¦â The whole interview was very inspiring and something that I never forgotâ¦Anderl Heckamer died on 2 February 2005, 98 years old.</p>

<p class="c3">- On Piccolo Lagazuoi</p>
<p>Looking back on âVia del Buco" - it was very satisfying 250metres long route with 10 pitches with all of the climbing moves in the IV grade area (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>). You have corners, slabs, overhang, roof and if not satisfied at the end you can always choose the exit 2 pitches graded V+ in a corner which now was dripping wet. Although in the guidebook it says âabundant protectionâ I would say that you would never regret taking a rack of nuts, cams and slings wherever you go in the Dolomites since here (and I am not blind) I could only find âabundant possibilities for protectionâ. There wasÂ always good enough crack for a cam or a place to put a sling aroundâ¦ Anyway, if climbing IV is well in your abilities you will enjoy the solid rock and keep climbing through the âhold-coveredâ route of Piccolo Lagazuoi without being bothered whether there is in-situ protection or you have to put it by your selfâ¦For the descent we were not sure about the length of the abseil (it is not written in the book) so we climbed with a single rope and Vesna carried another rope in case the abseil is longer then 25m. But there was no need for abseil at all. There is an excellent system of fixed steel cord and a very solid bridge that got us on the old military path that took us on the approach route.</p>

<p>4 June<br/>
The next day we went to find the approach route for Punta Fiames, the most westerly summit in the Pomagagnon group to the north of Cortina. Punta Fiames is a most awe-inspiring sight entering Cortina by car driving from Belluno. The moment I saw it on the picture in the guidebook, I wanted to do it. However, the day was all cloudy and rainy so it was a nice rest day. We couldnât climb for sure, but we could hike up and check the approach. We parked the car at the hospital complex driving to Olimpia Camping and from there over the meadow we got on the wide path numbered 211. Bearing leftwards we got into a junction point and followed the path 202 that got us through the pine tree forest to the scree from where another junction and a marked path with regular red/white paint (no numbers on it) leads under the South Face of Punta Fiamesâ¦ At the moment when I got to the very start of the route after about 2 hours approach it started to rain more heavily and we walked (and scrambled through the upper approach chimneys) back. All we needed was a clear day...</p>

5 June<br/>
During the night it rained heavily and we didnât want to climb on a wet 400m high rock that looked slabbyâ¦ But we didnât want to lose another day's either so we decided to go towards the Lake Misurina and climb on the nearby Piz Popena Basso. This is a 2224m high mountain where on its East Face we climbed 2 routes. The first one (graded IV+, length 120m) was first climbed by Mazzorana/Adler party on 17 August 1936, and the second one (graded IV, length 130m) was first climbed by Piero Mazzorana on 23 September 1931. They both had 4 pitches. We parked the car on the parking of the Misurina Hotel and after about 45 minutes got under the routes. This was the first time when we met local Italian climbers. It was good that they came after us since 2 parties (5 people) were climbing the first route that we wanted to do and we saw they were still there when we finished it and were at the foot of the wall searching for the start of the second route. Both routes were easy - there was a nice exposed traverse and an easy overhang of IV at the first one. As for the second one, all that I can say is â chimneying. Although the route starts following a corner, my abiding memory is of the chimneys.Â I really liked them. They were perfectly sized (not too narrow or wide) and climbing at that grade I started to like chimneying again. I found the rock more slippery somehow and there were also a few overhangy slabs and cracks that for a moment made me think that they should perhaps be graded a half-grade more, but it is OK. Good holds â just have to stretch and find them and here there was enough in-situ protection, especially on the crux points. Even knowing this I would advise you to take some slings and nuts, you will at least feel more confidentâ¦</p>

<p><a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/srichinmoy">Sri Chinmoy</a> gave the last concert in Torino on 30th May. We spent the night in the camp in the town and early in the morning we departed towards Cortina dâAmpezzo (via Venice and Belluno). Driving through highways all the way from Skopje we saw only plain fields and roads but when we started driving from Belluno towards Cortina the mountains started to show up and I started getting excited about the climbs getting so close. It was very satisfying finally driving through the scenic mountain roads and villages of Northern Italy and seeing the big walls of the mountains and towers rising out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/cort"/></p>
<p class="c3">- Cortina d'Ampezzo and the surrounding mountains</p>
<p>The period end of May / start of June is what is called âearlyâ season in the Dolomites for climbing. The South sides of the mountains were clean of snow (as were all our chosen routes) but on the northern slopes there was still some snow to be found â especially in the steep and narrow gullies where we were supposed to pass on our way down. It was also off-season in the town of Cortina dâAmpezzo. When we arrived, the town was empty with only few people on the streets, many shops were closed due to âholidaysâ (for a month) and out of five camps only 2 were open. We settled down in the Cortina Camping and decided that next<br/>
day we would start our climbing.</p>
<p>31 May<br/>
Few routes had a start from the Falzarego Pass that is about 15km away from the town. This mountain pass is on 2117m height and we drove on the curved road from Cortina with a doubtful feeling about the weather since it was cloudy and grayish. As we arrived on the pass and looked towards Sass di Stria, the route we wanted to climb that day, we saw its top covered in clouds. Deciding to climb it anyway, we parked the car on the road towards Valparolla Pass where there is a small parking place âmarkedâ with a big boulder on the left side. From here, there is a path that leads to the route that passes under the wall of the mountain and we came at the start in about 20 minutes. The start was marked with a driven in piton on the right side of the rib and putting the guidebook in my upper pocket of the backpack, after a moment of silence and concentration I headed up. The South Rib was first climbed by the Cobertaldo/Pezzoti party on 1 August 1939. It is an easy IV+ route (see <a href="http://climbing.srichinmoyraces.org/basicinfo/rsys">Rating Systems</a>) that follows the right side of the rib with occasional turns on right (passing under harder, overhang-like problems) and one rightwards traverse on the last pitch over a big ledge that got us under the crux of the route â a IV+ crack that leads to the top. It was a good introduction route for the Dolomites. We used it to check out if the gradings in the guidebook are as same as or close to the gradings that we climb on our local crags and to feel the rock. In the first two pitches I felt the rock a little slippery but we got used to it very fast and what satisfied us as far as we have climbed on limestone this rock was very solid and firm. We liked it a lot. When we got on the top we had a very nice look towards the surrounding valleys and mountains and also we could see the Falzarego Torres that we wanted to do next.</p>

<p>1 June<br/>
This day we wanted to do 2 routes on the Two Torres di Falzarego that are c.2500m high. The route that we wanted to climb on Torre Piccola di Falzarego was on the South ArÃªte, first climbed by Comici/del Torso/Varale party on 10 August 1934. It was graded IV+ and it had 7 pitches. The route on Torre Grande di Falzarego was on the West Face and was first climbed by S. Lussato on 13 August 1957. It was graded IV and it had 4 pitches. We wanted to do these routes in one day since when abseiling down from Torre Piccola we would come into the gap between the two towers and after short scramble in the gully we would be directly at the start of the other route. We parked the car about 1km before Falzarego Pass driving from Cortina at the parking of a restaurant and after a walk of about an hour we were at the start of the Piccola route. When I was ready to start I had a quick look at the watch that I had in the pocket of my backpack and it said 10:30. The route starts on a ledge about 10 meters to the right from the arÃªte and after 2 pitches of IV/IV+ joins the arÃªte. It was written that it starts under a painted number â10â â I could only see the painted number about 10 meters up from the ledge and it was only when I looked up the face standing at the foot of the chimney that is located at the far left side of this ledge that I saw itâ¦ Anyway, at the harder pitches there was enough in â situ protection and only the first 3 pitches were âthe harder onesâ. I would like to say that even when someone says that there is enough protection on some Dolomite route, you should always bring some slings and nuts because if you are not used to climb with in-situ protection on bigger distances you may find it âtrickyâ. After that it was easy climbing on grade III+ and we came to the top. There we saw few cemented belay bolts but the actual abseil station was located on a path few meters from the top when we looked down towards Torre Grande. From there we made a 25m abseil that brought us on a terrace from where we were supposed to go into the gap between the Torresâ¦ As we sorted out the gear in the backpacks, I looked at the watch and it said 15:30â¦ 5 hours?!?! I could not believe my eyes. I told Vesna about this and we sat in silence for a while. We climbed the route without having almost any problem of route finding and it was all somehow much fasterâ¦ We decided to go down.</p>
<p class="c3"><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/falpass"/><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/torre2"/><img src="http://www.srichinmoyraces.org/torre"/></p>
<p class="c3">- Falzarego Pass and the two Torres di Falzarego</p>
<p>When we came to the car there was one Italian climber (we climbed with him when he visited Macedonia) with a friend who said that he was surprised seeing us down instead of climbing another route since it was only 13:30. Now I could not believe my ears; I checked my watch and it said 16:30. After getting into the car I realized this watch had two timers (during the climb I probably unknowingly pressed the button for the timer to changeâ¦), and because I hardly ever used the two timers I completely forgot about them - and to make things worse, we could have easily climbed the other route alsoâ¦ Our friends climbed Sass di Stria that afternoon and Vesna and I went to find the start of a route that we wanted to do on Picolla Lagazuoi. We went that night for pizza and decided that we would have another try tomorrow Â â with Vesna I would go on Torre Grande and our friends would repeat the route that we did today. We showed them the description, told them all they needed to know and the next day we split half way on the approach route and headed towards Torre Grande. Â We saw where this route started the day before, so it was an easy start and easy climbing. The crux slabs were blackened with water, which made them slippery, but it was not a big problem since the route was short and this was only for about few meters. After an easy scramble of II/III at the last pitch we were on the top and we sat<br/>
relaxed for a while.</p>
<p>2 June<br/>
We cast our eyes towards Lagazuoi, since we wanted to do a route there and also towards Tofana di Rozes. We wanted to do 2 routes on this big mountain also but the conditions there were still bad. The exit route was still much under snow and a few friends who were hiking there the day before told us said a big avalanche came off passing very close to them. The south face during the days while we were there was always covered with clouds and we could not see as much as half of the wall. Coming down from Torre Grande was tricky. We put all our equipment in our backpacks since in the guidebook it was written that we have to âdescent a short, chossy gully to a notchâ¦from there less distinct pathââ¦ We thought this means an easy scramble down, but the gully was very exposed with walls going way down from each side and it was tricky climbing down through a very broken terrain. There were cemented rings, which we could use for abseil or mid-belay points coming down roped together but we didnât want to take off the equipment from the backpacks so we moved very slowly and it was OKâ¦ On the way down we met with the two friends of ours â they came out mid way of the Piccola route since there were few parties climbing slowly in front of them. At Torre Piccola just when you will pass the first 3 pitches there is a ledge from where you can descend to a path that will get you on the approach routeâ¦So this was the third route that we did and for the next day we planned to do a route on Piccola Lagazuoi with which we would make a climb on all the mountains that are around Falzarego offered in the guidebook. We were having nice climbing but we were not very happy about the weather since every afternoon the sky would get covered with clouds and we couldnât make a brave decision to climb something much longer the next day not knowing how the weather would go. Each morning when we would see that the sky had not so many clouds, we would go and climb this short routes but later in the day the weather would change (while climbing we could see how the clouds were coming over from the west) and it was raining almost every afternoon or night. But we decided to climb the 250m high wall of the Piccolo Lagazuoi anyway since it was not that big and the route was fairly easy, at least in the<br/>
